Hi there. I'm a writer based in Houston, Texas. I study [creative writing at the University of Houston](http://www.uh.edu/class/english/programs/graduate/creative-writing/), where I'm an assistant nonfiction editor for [_Gulf Coast_](http://gulfcoastmag.com). And I blog about American politics for [_The Economist_](http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica).

My work has appeared in _The Atlantic_, _The Economist_, _The Daily_, The Boston Review_, _Reason_, _Forbes_, _The Daily Beast, Bloomberg, Slate_, _Prospect_, and a variety of other publication online and off. I've been a columnist for _The Week, _a regular writer for _The Economist_'s economics blog, a regular on Bloggingheads TV, and a regular commentator for American Public Media's radio program Marketplace. I also dabble in [illustration](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/faces-of-iowa-sketches-from-the-ames-straw-poll/243618/).

A recovering Washingtonian, I was a research fellow at the Cato Institute for five years, and before that did stints at the Mercatus Center and the Institute for Humane Studies. 

I live in Houston, Texas with my wife, [Kerry Howley](http://kerryhowley.com), and our Vizsla, Winston.
