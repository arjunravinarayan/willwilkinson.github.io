I'm a writer based in Houston, TX. I blog about American politics for <em><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica">The Economist</a> </em>and study <a href="http://www.uh.edu/class/english/programs/graduate/creative-writing/">creative writing at the University of Houston</a>.

My work has appeared in <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>The Economist</em>, <em>The Daily, The Boston Review</em>, <em>Reason</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, <em>The Daily Beast, Bloomberg, Slate</em>, <em>Prospect</em>, and a variety of other publication online and off. I've been a columnist for <em>The Week, </em>a regular writer for <em>The Economist</em>'s <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/">Free Exchange</a> economics blog, a regular on Bloggingheads TV, and a regular commentator for American Public Media's radio program Marketplace. I also dabble in illustration. So far, my illustration work has appeared in <em>Defunct </em>and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/faces-of-iowa-sketches-from-the-ames-straw-poll/243618/"><em>The Atlantic </em>online</a>.

A recovering Washingtonian, I was a research fellow at the Cato Institute for five years, and before that did stints at the Mercatus Center and the Institute for Humane Studies.

I live in Houston, Texas with my fiancée, <a href="http://kerryhowley.com">Kerry Howley</a> and our Vizsla, Winston.
