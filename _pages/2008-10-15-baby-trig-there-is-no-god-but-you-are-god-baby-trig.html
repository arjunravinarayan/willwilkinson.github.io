I already know what happens. John S. McCain rips Barack Obama's heart out <em>with his mind</em> and offers it to his puppet master God-King, a fuzzy white kitten in his pocket called Captain Wrath or Ho Chi Mittens. Joe Biden, watching from his handsome but not ostenatious home in Wilmington, Delaware is so profoundly humbled by the unearned prospect of overwhelming power that he slowly disrobes and sets off on foot, calmly, resolutely, nudely, toward the warehouse on the outskirts of Scranton where he murdered his twin. From a secret location slightly outside Earth continuity, Todd Palin, snow machine champion, expertly pilots a small remote-controlled dirigible into the debate hall and fetches Obama's still-beating heart with a retractable claw, and whisks it away to a magical basement (no stairs, just a dial of entering) where a transparent humanoid robot, filled with tiny replicas of Jeff Koons favorites smoothly floating in a glorious light that obscures them, stands over baby Trig into whose silken infant chest the Koonsotron sinks Obama's now-babbling heart, and baby Trig he levitates from the table narrow in his knitted eyes he pronounces, with the voice of a lion, "Thus shall ever be that which must be from forgetting." And he multiplies. Sarah Palin, forty feet tall and black as burnt buttons leads her hordes of minions across the fruited plain murdering the meek with death ray laser blast of congeniality from her warm, maternal eyes. Now 100,000,000 strong they throng beneath the Obelisk the sky blackened by a numberless swarm of chanting baby Trigs. No one. No one was waiting for. From his bed in St Peter Putin bolts upright in bed. What was that? What was that? His tongue begins to thicken. His gymnast stirs. Love?
