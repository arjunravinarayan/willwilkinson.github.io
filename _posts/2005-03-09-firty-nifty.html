In honor of Matt's safe return from <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2005/03/road_trip.html">the heart of darkness</a>, and in lieu of an actual blog post, I thought I would display my geographical experience of America:

<b>bold</b> the states you've been to, <u>underline</u> the states you've lived in and <i>italicize</i> the state you're in now...

<b>Alabama</b> / Alaska / <b>Arizona</b> / Arkansas / <b>California</b> / <b>Colorado</b> / Connecticut / <b>Delaware</b> / Florida / <u>Georgia</u> / Hawaii / Idaho / <u>Illinois</u> / <b>Indiana</b> / <u>Iowa</u> / <b>Kansas</b> / Kentucky / Louisiana / Maine / <u>Maryland</u> / <b>Massachusetts</b> / <b>Michigan</b> / <b>Minnesota</b> / Mississippi / <u>Missouri</u> / Montana / <b>Nebraska</b> / Nevada / New Hampshire / <b>New Jersey</b> / New Mexico / <b>New York</b> / <b>North Carolina</b> / <b>North Dakota</b> / <u>Ohio</u> / Oklahoma / Oregon / <b>Pennsylvania</b> / Rhode Island / <b>South Carolina</b> / <b>South Dakota</b> / <b>Tennessee</b> / Texas / Utah / <b>Vermont</b> / <u>Virginia</u> / Washington / <b>West Virginia</b> / <b>Wisconsin</b> / Wyoming / <em>Washington D.C</em> /

Go <a href="http://cow.org/cgi-bin/meme/state.cgi" target="_hi">HERE</a> to have a form generate the HTML for you.

My fudge is that I say I lived in Virginia. I never had a residence there. But I worked in Virginia for three years, and spent as much time there as Maryland or DC during that time. Of course DC isn't a state. But you knew that.
