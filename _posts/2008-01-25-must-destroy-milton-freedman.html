Translation:<span class="ej8B8e"> </span><span id="1g4l"></span>
<blockquote><span id="1g4l">Libertarianism is dangerous because it discourages juvenile romantic attachment to <em>higher </em>things -- <em>meaningful </em>things<em> --</em> like Honor, Virtue, and the indescribable joy of sacrificing one's life to the service of the American Volksreich. All libertarians care about is superficial shit like not starving, living a long time, and being creative and happy. Blah blah blah. But, really, what's the point of living to 200 if all you do is <em>enjoy yourself the whole time</em>? I mean, don</span>'t you want to know what it is like to kill a man? DON'T YOU WANT TO TASTE BLOOD!? Besides, virtue.

Oh, goodness that's not fair! But, really, that whole thing is just as embarrassing as misspelling 'Friedman'. I am more and more coming to the conclusion that National Greatness Conservatism, like all quasi-fascist movements, is based on a weird romantic teenager's fantasies about what it means to be a grown up. The fundamental moral decency of liberal individualism seems, to the unserious mind that thinks itself serious, completely insipid next to very exciting big boy ideas about shared struggle, sacrifice, duty, glory, virtue, and (most of all) power. And reading Aristotle in Greek.

I sometimes think that liberal individualism is something like the intellectual and moral equivalent of the best modernist design -- spare, elegant, functional -- but hard to grasp or truly appreciate without a cultivated sense of style, without a little discerning maturity. National Greatness Conservatism is like a grotesque wood-paneled den stuffed with animal heads, mounted swords, garish carpets, and a giant roaring fire. Only the most vulgar tuck in next to that fire, light a fat cigar, and think they've really got it all figured out. But I'm afraid that's pretty much the kind of thing you get at the Committee on Social Thought. If you declaim the importance of virtue loudly enough, you don't have to actually think.
