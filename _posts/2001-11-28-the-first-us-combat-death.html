The first U.S. combat death, Johnny "Mike Spann, a CIA agent, has been <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/STRIKE_MAIN.html">officially reported.</a> First, it's just amazing that it took this long for an American death. Second, it's <b>really</b> amazing that your chances of dying appear to be higher if you're a journalist than if you're a U.S. combat troop.
