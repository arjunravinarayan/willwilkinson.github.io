<a href="http://austrianeconomists.typepad.com/weblog/2009/01/stimulus-or-carpe-diem-the-new-deal-wasnt-a-stimulus-package-either.html">Steve Horwitz totally nails it</a>:
<blockquote>This [the stimulus bill] isn't just your run-of-the-mill pork.  What we are seeing happen right now is that Congress sees this crisis as an opportunity to enact a whole variety of programs that they've wanted to pass for years, especially (but <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/01/26/republicans-seek-lasting-damage-in-the-stimulus/">not only</a>) the Democrats who no longer fear a veto, and now finally have the chance.  Just as the Patriot Act was a bunch of laws waiting for a political "crisis," so is much of the stimulus package a bunch of programs waiting for an economic "crisis."  The current crisis is just a convenient excuse.</blockquote>
Disaster dirigisme.
