In <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/14231">this week's Free Will</a>, I chat with Bloggingheads TV's resident experimental philosopher, Joshua Knobe, about getting out of the armchair and doing philosophy and economics using more direct empirical methods. Among other things, we talk about people's intuitions about free will and responsibility, the "reverse experience machine," and other fascinating subjects.

Up next on Free Will: Saul Smilansky on his incredibly stimulating new book <em>Ten Moral Paradoxes.</em>

Here's Josh and I talking about the experience machine. Sorry about the bad sound on my end. (First diavlog ever from Marshalltown, and I forgot a decent microphone!)
