So I guess the crack about neo-libertarianism is going to be that it is neither new, nor libertarian, I guess that would be right, but that's not the same as saying that it's wrong. I can't really fathom why someone would create a new magazine in this day and age and publish it as .pdf, for god's sake, so I had little interest in reading it, but I did want to see what Max Borders had to say, since we're having dinner together tonight. Max and I are both contractarians, and I think we each think the other doesn't understand contractarianism. We are in agreement that rights are conventional and not natural in the essentialist's sense. But I think he's truly confused about the state:

<blockquote>Rights and the State - The New Libertarian realizes that the state depends on individual rights for its existence. (Rights are its raison d'etre.) Likewise, the rights depend on the state for their continued existence. (Without enforcement, rights cannot be exercised.) The relationship between rights and the state is mutual. Thus the New Libertarian doesn't accuse the state of being the source of all problems. Rather, she is critical of the state when it steps outside its purview as protector of rights . . . </blockquote>

The relationship bewteen rights and the state is wrong in both directions here. First, it's a confusion to say that the state depends on rights for it's existence, or that rights are the state's reason for being. There are and have been very many states that arose by the systematic violation of rights, and that exist for the prupose of predation and conquest. Perhaps Max means to say that a <em>just</em> or <em>legitimate</em> state depends on rights for existence. A right is a norm, rule, or constraint on behavior that is justified by its role in facilitating a stable system of cooperation for mutual advantage. The state is justified or legitimate just in case its coercive apparatus is necessary to assure compliance with these norms, rules, or constraints.
