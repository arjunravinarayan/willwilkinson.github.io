I have a <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/07/libertarian-opt.html">long post up over at Overcoming Bias</a>, which is followed by a super-stimulating and challenging (to me, at least) comments thread.

Bryan Caplan <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/07/the_consequence.html">comments at EconLog</a> on the upsides of pessimistic bias.
