<b>The Meaning of Life</b> -- Read this <a href="http://w3.arizona.edu/~phil/faculty/extra/dschmidtz/dschmidtz_meanings_of_life.htm">moving essay</a> by David Schmidtz on the meanings of life, with a bit of autobiography. Find out how today's best libertarian political philosopher was saved at the last minute from a life as a mailman in Saskatchewan. Good philosophy and good reading.
