Salam, Douthat, and Menashi have taken over at AndrewSullivan.com. Weirdness ensues, and it's almost entirely Reihan's fault (or to Reihan's credit). Anyway, good stuff, at least that which is non-free-associative enough to comprehend. I'm interested in Douthat's thread on the <a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_12_19_dish_archive.html#110358553737036542">pointlessness of affirmative action</a> at elite schools.

A constant plinging note in my life is small-scale anxiety about my lack of academic pedigree. This note would not pling if I'd stayed on the farm, so to speak. But D.C. is so choked with Ivy, and Ivy-like educational product, that it's hard to avoid a sense of outsiderness, even if one is not actually excluded from anything. Me aside, my house is a Rice, Vassar, Columbia house. My friends are Harvard, Princeton, NYU, Hopkins, etc... sort of people. Michigan, maybe, if they're from the wilds.

The most prestigious school I've ever attended is the University of Maryland (US News: #56, National Universities; #18, National Public Universities). Within Beltway intellectual circles, attendance at UMD is considered regrettable, but not shameful. When I mention my degrees from UNI or NIU, I am generally met with an inadvertant-but-inevitable attitude of stupefied condenscension. The disposition of the mouth and brow, the tone of the "Oh," communicates a kind of surprise, as if they have suddenly registered the fact that, despite my deceptively non-retarded facade, I am in fact retarded. This shifts into a kind of wonder that I am able to pass for non-retarded in normal society, which gives way to a flash of self-consciousness about appearing patronizing and showing bad form. So it wraps up in a broad smile, chummy attitude and congratulations on how well I'm doing. No matter the attempt to avoid condescension, "despite your handicap," goes unspoken, but not unsaid.

Like I said, it's a small-scale anxiety. If I had any evidence that I'd ever been excluded from anything ever because of the schools I've attended, it would no doubt be more intense. I think I am victim of a kind of idle paranoia about social status. I'm thinking of that old Eddie Murphy SNL skit where we gets made up as a white guy
