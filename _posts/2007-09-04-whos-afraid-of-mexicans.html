People who never encounter them.

<a href="http://reason.com/news/show/122262.html">Kerry reports at <em>Reason</em></a> that state and local tough-on-immigration laws come primarily from places next to no one immigrates to.
<blockquote>In a report to be published by the <a href="http://www.ailf.org/">American Immigration Law Foundation</a> (AILF) in September, [San Diego State sociologist Jill] Esbenshade finds that almost 80 percent of the localities where ordinances have been discussed had <em>below</em> the national average of Latino population share in 2000.</blockquote>
I found this contrast especially illuminating:
<blockquote>Meanwhile, Missouri’s newly deputized immigration enforcers have claimed the right to detain even immigrants who would not otherwise be arrested. As Gov. Blunt fills the state's detention centers, he might ponder the last time the state experienced an “unnatural influx” of migrants. In the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, another politically unpopular group—Southern blacks—flooded into Missouri, bringing culture and identity, barbeque and blues. School kids learn to call that the “Great Migration”; politicians refer to today’s “immigration crisis.”</blockquote>
