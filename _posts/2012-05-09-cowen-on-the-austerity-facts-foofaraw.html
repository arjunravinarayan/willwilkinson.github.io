<blockquote>I don’t wish to respond point-by-point to some of the writings in the blogosphere, but given the above, Ryan Avent <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/05/euro-crisis-0?fsrc=gn_ep&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">also is not looking deeply enough.</a>  Both he and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/yes-theres-been-austerity-in-europe/2012/05/08/gIQAQ1NsAU_blog.html?wprss=rss_ezra-klein">Brad Plumer</a> did not see that the posts in question clearly distinguished between spending cuts and “austerity” (Brad did issue what is arguably a correction.)  I admire both bloggers and read them regularly, but these two posts both fail; here are <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/299373/debate-over-austerity-continues-veronique-de-rugy">some comments from Veronique</a>.  I would say there is a dominant narrative, repeated many times in not always precise language, which people find it very hard to think outside of.

Most of the time “austerity” is a misleading word and more precise concepts — readily intelligible I might add — are available.  There really are some times when we should relabel austerity as “mostly tax increases,” but many people are reluctant to do so.</blockquote>
