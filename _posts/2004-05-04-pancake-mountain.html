-- How is it possible that I was unaware of <a href="http://www.pancakemountain.com/index.html">Pancake Mountain</a>, a prototype of a surreal children's show featuring Ian MacKaye, Bob Mould, Thievery, Uncalled4 (a swell <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/archives/cover/2000/cover0114.html">go go</a> band, for you people who live in an actual state) and other "famous for DC" types? Do check out MacKaye's new endeavor, the Evens, performing "<a href="http://www.pancakemountain.com/tvev.html">Vowel Movement</a>" and Anti-Flag doing a quite rousing version of the <a href="http://www.pancakemountain.com/tvaf.html">Pancake Mountain theme song</a>. Who wouldn't expose their children to luddish, anti-corporate propaganda if the music was this good? If <a href="http://www.turner.com/planet/">Captain Planet</a> had cameos by, say, <a href="http://www.windmeupchuck.com/">Chuck Brown</a>, I'd tune in.
