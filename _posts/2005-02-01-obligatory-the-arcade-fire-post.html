Yes, <a href="http://listenmissy.com/blog/archives/001285.php#001285">Missy</a>, I was there. And though I hate to perpetuate the conventional wisdom, it really was pretty great.

I still wish DC people weren't so lame, and would dance or at least bop more, but I guess that can't be helped.

I loudly booed that Owen wanker from Final Fantasy when he said that we should all love taxes, because "it makes us into a community" or some such frostback nonsense. I brayed my disapproval apparently alone, although the guys standing next to me gave me a smile and an approving nod meant to communicate solidarity, but which communicated only cowardice. Note to Republican hill staffers who like good music: you paid to hear good music, not a CBC editorial. Go ahead, let 'em know you hate it. The hipsters are more afraid of you than you are of them and <em>will not beat you.</em> And, finally... Note to DC canuckophile "progressives": Do it. Really. Go. Seriously. It really is better there. Go. Do it. It's a glittering frosty wonderland of social justice. Live the dream! Go!

(Note: I get to say "frostback," etc. because I am half Canadian ... like if I was half black, I could make fun of black people, Chris Rock style. I am not, as it happens, half black, so I will never ever ever make fun of black people. But I do reserve the right to mock Canadians.)
