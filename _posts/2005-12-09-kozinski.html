Sorry. I won't make this into the "what's new at Cato Unbound" blog, but I do want to use whatever platform I have to get good altitude from our launch issue.

So, let all be aware that Alex Kozinski, the funniest man in the federal judiciary, and maybe the smartest (if Posner gets abducted by aliens), <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2005/12/09/alex-kozinski/reply-to-buchanan-2/">replies to Buchanan today</a>.

A taste? Regarding the nondiscrimination amendment:

<blockquote>In effect, we’d have Bush v. Gore going on 365 days a year, all over the country. As a prescription for curtailing governmental action, this would surely work. But it would also remove much of the power of government from elected officials and give it to un-elected federal judges. The push to appoint judges sympathetic to the government’s current policies will be strong, and we will look on the “mild” confirmation battles of the past as the good old days.</blockquote>
