Tim Lee has a <a href="http://www.binarybits.org/archives/2005/05/catastrophic_no.html">good post on HSAs</a> in response to this <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2005/05/hsa_thought.html">bit of Ygelasiasism</a>. (By the way, if Matt's claim that HSA's will hasten the arrival of socialized medicine in America is not a fine, fine specimen of the pundit's fallacy, then hope has never triumphed over intelligence.)
