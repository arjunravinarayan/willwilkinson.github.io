There's some interesting stuff in this otherwise ponderous Newsweek on the decline of creativity in kids.
<blockquote>Having studied the childhoods of highly creative people for decades, Claremont Graduate University’s Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and University of Northern Iowa’s Gary G. Gute found highly creative adults tended to grow up in families embodying opposites. Parents encouraged uniqueness, yet provided stability. They were highly responsive to kids’ needs, yet challenged kids to develop skills. This resulted in a sort of adaptability: in times of anxiousness, clear rules could reduce chaos—yet when kids were bored, they could seek change, too. In the space between anxiety and boredom was where creativity flourished.</blockquote>
I feel that this perfectly describes my childhood. Super-stable, relatively conservative rule-bond household with lots of encouragement from my parents. I was often described by my exasperated teachers as "very creative."

Remember this?

<a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/drawme.jpg"></a>At fourteen I did a pretty sweet pirate (not that it matters), sent it in, a representative from the Art Instruction Schools came in due course to our home, explained to my parents that my level of skill was just right to benefit from the program. (Perhaps they say this to everyone, but it happened to be true.) So they signed me up, and I went through the lessons, which were actually extremely helpful. Thanks to the skills I learned, it became easier for me to effectively experiment creatively in my art, which was mostly superheroes, but still. At seventeen I won a prize in an art competition, which led to a summer scholarship at a real art school (SCAD), which helped me build an unusually mature portfolio for a high school student and win a full-tuition art scholarship to Northern Iowa--an excellent outcome for a decidedly mediocre student. My super-square parents were unflaggingly supportive of my interests in art, music, and theater even when I took it in "weird" (for them) directions. I'm really grateful for this, and I think it has a lot to do with my comfort in experimenting with ideas, and developing a sometimes idiosyncratic take on things.
