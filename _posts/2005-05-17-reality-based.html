OK. I'm officially sick of it. The very moment folks started calling themselves "members of the reality-based community," it made me want to wretch on my Pumas. Why not be honest and call yourself a proud member of the "you're either stupid or evil if you don't agree with me community?" I understand the supposed contrast with "faith-based" and the ironic embrace of its derisively intended non-opposite. But come on, really. I think we all understand and appreciate what a hard-headed empiricist you are by not attending Sunday school. Your epistemic virtue bowls us over. But just maybe it's time for new blog slogans, people. Why not try something along "my scat smells like honey-based" or "self-congatulation-based" lines?
