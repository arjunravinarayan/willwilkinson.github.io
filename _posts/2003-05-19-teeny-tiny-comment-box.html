-- Some administrivia . . . Because every third comment I receive is a complaint about my comments software, I decided finally to repair the problem, which, for the most part, was simply the size of the text fields. This took some doing on my part as by now I had totally forgotten how I had installed my comments software, how the template editing interface works, etc... But I did it, FOR YOU, the loyal commentator.
