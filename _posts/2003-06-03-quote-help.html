-- O' disembodied spirit of the information superhighway, lend me your wisdom! There is a quote, by a semi-notable, that I pledge myself to remember each time I read it, yet each time I forget. The gist is that the appearance of conformity makes it possible to be deviant, because it won't occur to anyone that you're not entirely normal. Let this saying be revealed... NOW!
