Since I started working at Cato, I've become more sensitive to the fact that folks often write it "CATO." Now, this may be because of the the logo, which is all caps, but <a href="http://www-hoover.stanford.edu/">lots</a> of<a href="http://www.mercatus.org/"> organizations</a> have logos in all caps, and people don't write it that way. So I think folks must think CATO is some kind of acronym, like the CIA or something. This suggests a comments box game! If Cato was really CATO and CATO was an acronym, what would it stand for?

I'll get you started. Kelly in the Westminster rumpus room suggests "Center for Advanced Tautological Observation." Now you!
