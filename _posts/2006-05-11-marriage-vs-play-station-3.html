Reihan Salam and I have a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2141633/">rather profound piece</a> in Slate's "Dismal Science" slot arguing that a PS3 will make you happier than marriage.  Please note that all specious and sophistical reasoning is presented in the service of satire. No cogent  arguments were harmed in the writing of this article.
