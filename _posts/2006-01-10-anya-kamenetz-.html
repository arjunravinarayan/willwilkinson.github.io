From Daniel Gross's Slate piece on insufferable, whining 20-somethings:

<blockquote>Look. It's tough coming out of Ivy League schools to New York and making your way in the world. The notion that you can be—and have to be—the author of your own destiny is both terrifying and exhilarating. And for those without marketable skills, who lack social and intellectual capital, the odds are indeed stacked against them. But someone like Kamenetz, who graduated from Yale in 2002, doesn't have much to kvetch about. In the press materials accompanying the book, she notes that just after she finished the first draft, her boyfriend "proposed to me on a tiny, idyllic island off the coast of Sweden." She continues: "As I write this, boxes of china and flatware, engagement gifts, sit in our living room waiting to go into storage because they just won't fit in our insanely narrow galley kitchen. We spent a whole afternoon exchanging the inevitable silver candlesticks and crystal vases, heavy artifacts of an iconic married life that still seems to have nothing to do with ours." The inevitable silver candlesticks? Too much flatware to fit in the kitchen? We should all have such problems.

And does her fiance have one of those crap temporary jobs all the drones in her generation are destined to hold forever? Not really. He's a software engineer at Google.</blockquote>

Gack! What concerns me about this young lady is that she is either cravenly opportunistic to have attempted to benefit by writing a book about how bad she has it despite her astounding, world-historical privilege. Or she is sincere, which is worse, and therefore totally insensate to the fact that she is dripping in luxury, and it simply did not occur to her that she made herself look like kind of Ivied ass so isolated from the broader socio-economic reality that less priveleged people wouldn't even bother to hold in contempt if we didn't know that we're going to have to put up with her addled nonsense for another forty years during her undeserved tenure as a well-published social commentator. No doubt she thinks she has it bad because some of her Yalie friends have trust funds and big apartments. Gack, I say.

Let's see, after I graduated from the University of Northern Iowa I moved to Iowa City and worked at Arby's for a year, before deciding to go to grad school. (My girlfriend/rooommate then, still in school full time, worked at Jimmy Johns and as a waitress at some burritos and margaritas joint.) During my MA program at Northern Illinois, I worked at a bookstore and ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches so often that I actually shed tears of relief when I ate a chicken and mashed potatoes dinner at a mediocre diner after my grandma sent me some birthday money. In order to finance my trip out east to the PhD program at Maryland I worked third shift stocking dairy at the DeKalb, IL Super Wal-Mart. And the thing is <em>it simply never once occured to me that I did not have it good.</em> I was going to college.  I was going to grad school. I had the enviable leisure to study practically frivolous but spiritually satsifying things like art and philosophy. If I skimped on food I could afford paint and cheap used books and give myself a really great education.

Now, it's really uncomfortable to slap down the mid-America, middle-class card like this because I know it sounds like whining, and my brand of mid-American, middle-class people disdain whining above all else. Let's just say this is a bit of context for the clearly context-disabled Ms. Off-the-Coast-of-Sweden. Our world of Arby's and Wal-Mart is a world where it is incredibly easy to find a job, make a living, and buy a slightly dog-eared copies of the Nichomachean Ethics and Economics in One Lesson in paperback for a dollar while you prepare to move on to a better thing. And even if you didn't graduate from Yale! I don't in the least resent people who have had the good fortune to enjoy even more freedom and luxury than I had---who have had the kind of advantages I would like my children to have. I am just extremely grateful for the amazing freedom and luxury into which I was born and raised. Many more of my hours have been spent stupefied by the sheer wonder of the fact that I have been able to get the kind of education I got, and lead the kind of life I have led, than spent railing against the unfairness of a world that has given me---given us all---a lot more than something for nothing. People who have it really, really, really good it even better should be even more grateful than me.  So it is galling in the extreme to hear the lamentations of Ms. Kamenetz. I hope that should I ever meet her, I have the strength of will to say something not entirely impolite.
