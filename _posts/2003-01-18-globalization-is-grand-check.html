<b>Globalization is Grand! </b>-- Check out the <a href="http://www.theihs.org">Institute for Humane Studies' </a>loverly new website on globalization, <a href="http://www.aworldconnected.org">A World Connected</a>. Too often, the debate about globalization proceeds in terms of tired, potted arguments. A World Connected gets past that by focusing on <a href="http://www.aworldconnected.org/subcategory.php/84.html">stories of real people</a> around the world whose lives have been improved by increasing global interconnectivity. Check it out. And if you've got a blog, help IHS spread the word, and give A World Connected a plug.
