As far as I can tell, the opponents of a system of personal social security accounts lean almost entirely on two arguments. (1) There is no social security crisis; (2) The transition costs are too high.


You do not own your social security benefits.
Whether or not your benefits are cut, the retirement age is raised, or you get any benefits at all, is subject to the whims of politicians. You receive benefits enitirely at the pleasure of congress. This is not security.
