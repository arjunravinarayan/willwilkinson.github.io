I neglected to link my <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/video.php?id=270">most recent appearance on Bloggingheads TV</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Brooks">Rosa Brooks</a>. I found Rosa really interesting, and really enjoyed the conversation. I'm sure we disagree about a lot of stuff, but we seem to have found a bunch of topics where we mostly agree. Fun fact: I just discovered this morning that Rosa is Barbara Ehrenreich's daughter, which might have been interesting to know when we were discussing the intergenerational transmission of ideology, though, deracinated liberal individualist that I am, I'm sure I wouldn't have brought it up.
