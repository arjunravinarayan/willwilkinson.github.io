<b>The Keen Wind of Understanding -- </b>From <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/scienceandnature/0,6121,894941,00.html">Richard Holloway's review </a>of Dawkins's new book, <i>A Devil's Chaplain</i>:

<i>The goal of life is life itself. There is no final purpose, no end other than entropy and the end of all endings. But there is deep refreshment to be had "from standing up full-face into the keen wind of understanding".</i>

Beautiful.
