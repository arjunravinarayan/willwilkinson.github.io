On the New Yorker fiction podcast, Rebecca Curtis reads Leonard Michaels' story "The Penultimate Conjecture." It's a terrific story, but I was not entirely satisfied with the summary discussion between Curtis and Deborah Triesman, the New Yorker fiction editor.

Nachmann, an accomplished but modest mathematician, overcomes his dislike of travel to fly to San Francisco to see a demonstration of the proof of "the penultimate conjecture," a problem he had once had the ambition to solve, but it seemed to him at this late stage of hrro to risky to undertake.
