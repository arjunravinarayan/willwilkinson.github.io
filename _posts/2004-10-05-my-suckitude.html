Yes. I suck. I have a blog, but I don't blog on my blog, which sucks. All apologies.

I returned yesterday from Tucson where I was attending the annual International Society for the New Institutional Economics conference, and enjoying the hospitality and company of <a href="http://phil.web.arizona.edu/faculty/dschmidtz.htm">Dave Schmidtz</a>.

Let me say this about Tucson: when they say "dry" heat, they're not just saying it. I was drinking like a parched camel, yet my lips and mouth felt like I was slowly dying for want of moisture. I guess it takes getting used to for natives of >90% humidity climes. That said, the landscape was just astonishing for this Iowa boy. The <a href="http://www.americansouthwest.net/arizona/saguaro/snpwide4.html">saguaro forests</a> (through which Dave took me on a hike) looked unearthly to my midwestern eyes, but beautiful all the same. The <a href="http://www.desertmuseum.org/">Desert Museum</a> is lovely.

I caught up with a number of friends and acquaintances at ISNIE. Had a very nice dinner with Paul Edwards, Doug North, Timur Kuran, Mary Shirley, and Mat McCubbins at a very good, but comically pretentious, restaurant at a nearby resort. <a href="http://members.cox.net/kylehampton/">Kyle</a> and his girl Carolyn (sp?) took me to South Tucson for Mexican hot dogs at a wonderful dingy joint with no walls and a spiffy mariachi band.

I'm working on some ideas for articles focusing on the intersection of the brain and cognitive sciences with economics. I interviewed a few folks at ISNIE, and plan on interviewing a few more. Almost none of what I get in the interviews will go in any sort of article, so I'm thinking that if I can get permission, I'll put some choice bits of interviews with smart people doing hott economic science here on the blog to satisfy your frustrated yearning for fresh Fly Bottle content.       Whaddya think of that? Would it make you happy?
