This week on Free Will, I <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/14577">chat with Cambridge political theorist David Runciman</a> about his new book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691129312?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0691129312&amp;adid=1BV9Y5Y9D9V1SNNWT7DT&amp;">Political Hypocrisy</a>.Â </em>

In case you're wondering, the discussion at the end centered on Clinton and Obama not because we don't think McCain is a hypocrite, but because it was far from clear that McCain had a chance to win the nomination when David was wrapping up his book, and so he doesn't talk much about him. If you're looking for a discussion of McCain's impressive record of hypocrisy, try my chat with Matt Welch.
