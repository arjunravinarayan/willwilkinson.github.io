I'm no lawyer. Not even a simple caveman lawyer. But my impression of <a href="http://www.fed-soc.org/pdf/domesticsurveillance.pdf">this</a> [pdf] is that my Cato colleague Bob Levy opened up a whole can of lawerly whoopass on this Rivkin character. And that would be the 32 oz, not the 16 oz can. Rivkin may be able to sit comfortably in another month or so.

I truly feel better knowing Bob is looking after my liberty.
