Wow. I sure wouldn't have predicted back in the days of MDOP that Jimbo and Larry would get <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200609/wikipedia">profiles in the the <em>Atlantic</em></a> for their contributions to the cataloguing of human knowledge. Actually, I wouldn't have predicted when I was involved in the early stages of Nupedia (I have an unfinished article on "the paradox of analysis" laying around somewhere) that Wikipedia would become some kind of elemental force of nature. So you never know!
