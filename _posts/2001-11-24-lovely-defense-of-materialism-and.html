<a href="http://www.politechbot.com/p-02831.html">Lovely defense of materialism and individualism</a> as the source of American generosity by Lawrence Lindsay (economic advisor to Bush) at Declan McCullagh's Politech. Especially cool: Lindsay gives props to Frank O'Connor (i.e., Ayn Rand's wife), and dwells on skyscraper symbolism.
