-- Well, it's <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2003_10_01_notesarch.html#106581558301232068">that time again</a>. What was once fresh and exciting is now a DC institution. No doubt at Blogorama X we will present a lifetime achievement award to a superannuated 28 year old blogger, retired due to carpal tunnel and myopia.

Last time, there was a fire across the street. Let us pray for such excitement.
