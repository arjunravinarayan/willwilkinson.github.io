For a change, I liked <a href="http://left2right.typepad.com/main/2005/05/so_you_want_to_.html">this Elizabeth Anderson post</a> on Hayek and procedural justice. I don't think she gets anything wrong! But do see Steve Horwitz's <a href="http://left2right.typepad.com/main/2005/05/so_you_want_to_.html#c5887947">smart comment</a>, which contains worries I share.
