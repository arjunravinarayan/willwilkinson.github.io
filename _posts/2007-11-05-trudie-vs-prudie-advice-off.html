If you'll be in DC on November 15th, come to Cato to catch Tyler Cowen talk about <em>Discover Your Inner Economist </em>with comments from Emily Yoffe, author of <em>Slate's </em>"Dear Prudence" column. Here's the setup:
<blockquote>In <em>Discover Your Inner Economist</em>, the economist and blogger Tyler Cowen provides quirky and insightful advice for life based on his signature urbane style of economic reasoning. On his blog, <em>MarginalRevolution.com</em>, Cowen offers economic advice in his periodic "Dear Trudie" posts. Presumably Cowen offers good economics. But dare one take an economist's advice? Emily Yoffe, author of <em>Slate</em>'s popular "Dear Prudence" advice column, will advise. Please join us for an advice-off, as Trudie meets Prudie to discuss the practical benefits of economic reasoning (or lack thereof) in everyday life.</blockquote>
