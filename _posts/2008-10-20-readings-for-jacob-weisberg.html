<a href="http://www.fee.org/pdf/the-freeman/0810FreemanWhite.pdf">Larry White in <em>The Freeman</em></a> [pdf].

Oh, wait. I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Weisberg doesn't need to read this. <em>The Freeman</em> is a libertarian publication, and so you know <em>in advance</em> that Larry White's a utopian ideologue simply in denial of what we all already know. Sure, he may <em>seem</em> to cogently rebut a Paul Krugman column calling for increased government intervention in financial markets. But seriously, Larry White: <em>Haven't you people done enough harm already?</em>
