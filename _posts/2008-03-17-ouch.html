<a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/03/common-wealth-e.html">Tyler Cowen's take</a> on Jeffrey Sachs' new book:
<blockquote>Imagine a smart and diligent but not insightful or self-reflective person doing a "color by numbers" version of what a Jeffrey Sachs book should read like.</blockquote>
Shorter: Sachs has become a cartoon of himself.
