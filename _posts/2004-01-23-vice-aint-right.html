-- Joanne McNeill has <a href="http://www.joannemcneil.com/blog/archives/000269.html">the lowdown</a> on paunchy aging hipster Gavin McGinnes. His claim to be conservative was apparently a spoof. This supports my argument below that <em>claiming</em> to be conservative is likely to be cooler than actually being conservative. McGinnes does a great job of showing how very uncool conservatives are by showing us just how eager they are to associate themselves with anybody, ANYBODY, with a jot of hpister cred.
