<blockquote>Corporations are composed of people. So are unions. So are universities. So are families. The belief that we can somehow “tax corporations” without “taxing people” is the fallacy at the heart of Romney’s exchange. It’s the same with any collective: If we take away union rights, we take away the rights of individual union members. If we strip a university’s accreditation, we also strip credibility from its students and its graduates.</blockquote>
I am composed of cells. The belief that we can somehow tax me without taxing my cells is the fallacy at the heart of [<em>something something</em>.]

Is this not the fallacy of division? Why isn't Steve's version?
