<a href="http://www.deepthoughtblog.com/?p=83">This post</a> by one "Deep Thought" is a brilliant example:
<blockquote>This isn’t rocket science; men with easy access to prostitution or to promiscuous women have little incentive to marry. Suddenly there is nothing to offset their legal and financial obligations as a husband – so why take on the obligation? Women who are promiscuous face disease, pregnancy, and emotional trauma – all of them reduce their ability to be a valuable wife.</blockquote>
This probably helps explain what's going on with prostitution bans, but is it supposed to be <em>a moral reason </em>to<em> </em>endorse them? Dramatic reconstruction:
<blockquote>Sweetheart... Since I have no easy access to women who <em>sell</em> sex, will you share my life so I can use <em>you</em> for sex? I mean, even if there were a few more easy women around here, I'd have no use for you. Definitely no reason to make a commitment to you. But there aren't. Oh well. So... I love you? And Oh! Here's a diamond.</blockquote>
Maybe this tells us something about the great romance of being the mother of <a href="http://www.deepthoughtblog.com/?page_id=2">Deep Thought's four children</a>, but for my part, I share my life with Kerry because she is brilliant and exciting and we mesh in so many ways and I love her. As far as I can tell, the existence of Craiglist's <a href="http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/doc/cas/">Casual Encounters</a> has no bearing on this, my greatest source of happiness.

It gets even more obsessively biological. This is, sensibly enough I suppose, written by a Catholic guy with a theology degree who attends Latin mass and thinks "the Patriarchy, when controlled by Judeo-Christian morality, is a protector of and advocate for women." [!!!]:
<blockquote>the future belongs to those who show up. If you don’t have kids, you have no stake in the future. If you have kids, you not only have a stake in the future, you can influence it in ways almost impossible to duplicate without kids.

[...]

bans on prostitution exist not just to avoid the exploitation of sex workers; they are in place not just because the majority of world religions declare them immoral; they were passed not solely to fight the spread of disease; they were written with more than the goal of reducing the numbers of poor, fatherless children. No, they are there to protect the future.</blockquote>
Again, I can see the explanatory power here. But to think that this has justificatory power is simply grotesque. This is to reduce individual human beings to tokens of a biological type, to reduce the purpose of an individual human life to a link in a biological chain there is no moral value in forging. Yes, the future belongs to those who show up. But the <em>present</em> belongs to each individual human being. We have lives because a lineage has been perpetuated. But our lives are not <em>for </em>perpetuating lineages. Our lives are for<em> our</em> living. Our duty is to treat one another as free and equal persons, as ends in themselves, which means we are duty-bound <em>not </em>to use people and their lives for purposes not their own. We treat people with the respect they deserve. Whoever shows up, shows up. If <em>you're </em>interested in that, then breed away. But do leave the rest of us alone.
