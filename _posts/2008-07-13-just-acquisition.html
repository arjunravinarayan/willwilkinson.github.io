One of the chief criticisms of Nozick is that since we don't know whether original aquisition was just, we can't say whether the current distribution is just according the the entitlement theory. Surely someone other than Dave Schmidtz has made something like the following reply, and I'm asking you to tell me who it is.

Suppose (thinking nationalistically for convenience) a society's history of wealth looks something like this:

So there's something like 5X as much wealth a bit down the road. So obviously people aren't just moving potentially hot merchandise around. Wealth is being created. Suppose I stole a bunch of money from my mother in 1890 and started a company with it and made 200 honest people millionaires and they all start business which make other people rich and also offer consumers novel conveniences, etc. And my mother dies before I can pay her back. So what do we say peoples' entitlements to the wealth they helped create? Good for them is what I say! And, also, that I am a thief who ought to go to jail for stealing from my faultless mother. It strikes me that there is probably a big body of time-tested law that covers these kinds of cases. Did Nozick say something about this in particular? I wonder why philosophers don't wonder why that's good enough.
