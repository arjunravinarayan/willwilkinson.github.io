<html xmlns="">Tyler Cowen's <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/article-bd.cfm?piece=907">new essay on inequality in <em>The American Interest</em></a> is precisely the piece I've been longing for someone to write. Mr Cowen is, in my estimation, spot-on about the broad trends affecting levels of inequality. However, the real contribution here is Mr Cowen's astute analysis of the political economy of finance. The balance of available evidence suggests that most of the really striking action in rising inequality is at the very top of the income distribution, but the reason top incomes have raced so far ahead remains far from clear. I've long had the sense that folks in finance are getting spectacularly rich by somehow gaming the system, but the nature of that system is too inscrutable for me to formulate a sufficiently informed hypothesis on my own. But it's not so inscrutable to Mr Cowen. He offers what sounds to me a quite plausible story about the way the financial-regulatory-political system has been, and continues to be "gamed" and destabilized. "It’s as if the major banks have tapped a hole in the social till and they are drinking from it with a straw," Mr Cowen writes. His account of the way strategies of "going short on volatility" both increases inequality and threaten the stability of our entire market system is too detailed to summarise here. But I strongly sense that <em>some </em>story like this one largely explains the top 1 percent's dramatic separation from the rest of the income distribution. Here's Mr Cowen's bottom line:
<blockquote>For the time being, we need to accept the possibility that the financial sector has learned how to game the American (and UK-based) system of state capitalism. It’s no longer obvious that the system is stable at a macro level, and extreme income inequality at the top has been one result of that imbalance. Income inequality is a symptom, however, rather than a cause of the real problem. The root cause of income inequality, viewed in the most general terms, is extreme human ingenuity, albeit of a perverse kind. That is why it is so hard to control.</blockquote>
Surely there is some kind of structural injustice here. But it's just terrifically hard to say where precisely it lurks and what ought to be done about it. We can easily treat the symptomatic inequality through progressive redistribution, but this doesn't get at our deeper institutional malady. The deeper problem is that Wall Street can and continues to<em> </em>drink our milkshake--that there is a draining hole in the social till that has already caused our economy to collapse--not that the banker's portions of milkshake are growing faster than ours.

Mr Cowen's pessimistic conclusion meshes perfectly with <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/12/rigged_revolving_door">my bewilderment yesterday</a> about the implications of Peter Orszag's Wall-Street cash-out. Cowen:
<blockquote>Is the overall picture a shame? Yes. Is it distorting resource distribution and productivity in the meantime? Yes. Will it again bring our economy to its knees? Probably. Maybe that’s simply the price of modern society.</blockquote>
It would be lovely were some genius to offer us persuasive theoretical assurance that there exists <em>some </em>feasible system of political economy that creates at least as much wealth and welfare as does our own, but which is less both more stable and more just because less easily "gamed" by ingenious profit-seekers. Until then, we must consider the unhappy possibility that our current, insufferable arrangement of institutions is the best we know how to do.</html>
