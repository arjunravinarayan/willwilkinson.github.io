Are you in or around D.C.? Well, you're invited!

<strong>POLICY FORUM
Monday, October 29, 2007
12:00 PM (Luncheon to Follow)</strong>

Featuring <strong>Daniel Shapiro</strong>, Associate Professor of Philosophy, West Virginia University, with comments by <strong>Jason Furman</strong>, Senior Fellow and Director of the Hamilton Project, Brookings Institute and <strong>Will Wilkinson</strong>, Policy Analyst and Managing Editor of <em>Cato Unbound</em>, Cato Institute.

In his new book, <em>Is The Welfare State Justified?</em>, philosopher Daniel Shapiro insightfully combines moral and political philosophy with contemporary social science to argue that proponents of the welfare state — egalitarians, communitarians, and liberals alike — have misunderstood the implications of their own principles, which in fact support more market-based or libertarian institutional conclusions than most people realize. Please join us for a discussion of this important and controversial new book on the missing moral foundations of the welfare state.
