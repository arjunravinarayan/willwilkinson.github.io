<a href="http://www.reason.com/links/links122004.shtml">Good Reason piece</a> by Julian about the absolutely idiotic "Merry Christmas" controversy. I really dislike that one self-righteous athiest guy in the small town who calls the ACLU because there was a prayer before the public high school football game. And I really dislike the self-righteous Christian who thinks that an earnest attempt at inclusion in a pluralistic society is tantamount to an attack on Christendom. Oh, I don't know, why not just say what you like, and let other people say what they like, and when they say something other than what you would have said, say to yourself, hey, that's alright, that's how they roll. Really, it's easy if you try.

And, hey Christians! Jesus wasn't born in December, anyway. Solstice truly is the reason for the season! Happy Solstice!
