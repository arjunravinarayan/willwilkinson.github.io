<a href="http://www.positiveliberty.com/2009/04/hypocrisy-absolutely-no-moral-high-ground.html">Jason Kuznicki points us</a> to this excellent video...

As Jason says:
<blockquote>Couldn’t have said it better. If you take taxpayers’ money, you should have to treat all taxpayers equally. If you’re privately funded, you should be free to do as you like. Want to discriminate? Fine. Just don’t take tax money to do it.

And… if you support discrimination laws that touch purely private interactions and that benefit yourself, then you can hardly complain when others want those same benefits for their groups, too.</blockquote>
