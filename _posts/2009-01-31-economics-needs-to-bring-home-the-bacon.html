I'm glad my series of posts on the sorry state of macro has produced so many good responses. One of the best is Jim Manzi's new post at The Atlantic's Brave New Deal blog calling for more controlled experiments:
<blockquote>What is the key methodological feature that distinguishes science from the kinds of economic debates that frustrate Will: experiments.<span>  </span>Properly controlled experiments end debates (in addition, of course, to starting new ones). </blockquote>
This isn't just theory to Jim. He's built a successful business out of deploying experiment to answer for business questions unsuited to .
