Kerry's outstanding piece on access to experimental drugs from the August/September issue of Reason is <a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/120763.html">now available online</a>. I think the thing that sets this article apart from typical libertarian FDA hit pieces is the way it so evenhandedly explains the rationale for excluding some dying patients from clinical trials. There is no ideological table pounding. I really understand why the system works the way it does in a way I never did before. It is moving without being sentimental. And, overall, completely devastating.
