This is the sort of annoying my-party-is-pure-as-the-driven-snow their-party-stinks-of-sulfur attitude that I was <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/mt/mt.cgi?__mode=view&_type=entry&blog_id=2">complaining about below</a>.
<a href="http://majikthise.typepad.com/majikthise_/2004/10/gop_voter_suppr.html">Lindsay bitches about GOP voter suppression in Ohio</a>. I don't believe I remember her complaining (correct me if I'm wrong) about DNC voter suppression (successful or not) in every state in which they tried to cripple democracy by sueing Nader off the ballot. (If I ever hear high-toned democracy rhetoric from Larry Tribe, I'll throw up a little in my mouth.) Second, Lindsay simply assumes that stationing people in polling places to challenge fraudulent voters from voting is an ploy to suppress Democratic votes. But why not assume instead, or in addition, that the huge Democratic voter-registration drives really were riddled with malfeasance. Indeed, I assume both. The Democrats have been signing up dead people, felons and non-citizens in an attempt to steal the vote. The Republicans want to stop Democrats from stealing the vote, and so want to guard against dead and illegal voters, and, as a bonus, to suppress the legitimate Democratic vote--in an attempt to steal the vote.

Now, I want to emphasize that I don't think any of these shenanigans   even approaches the seriousness of the DNC's effort to make it impossible for American citizens to vote for a candidate who represents their views.
