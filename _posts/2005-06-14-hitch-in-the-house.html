Hitchens is now testifying to the DC City Council against the proposed smoking ban, and given how, um, sobriety compromised he seems to be, he did a quite fine job of working the sainted Carol Schwartz up into a good freedom of choice lather.

Oh, now repartee with the demonic Jim Graham. Something about Iraq-Kurdistan being the smoking--or at least smoldering--section of the middle east. And this is nice, and sadly true: "You're treating us like children; retarded children at that."

Sigh.
