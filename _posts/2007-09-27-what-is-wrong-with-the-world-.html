This is <a href="http://www.whatswrongwiththeworld.net/2007/09/why_will_wilkinson_has_no_argu.html">just getting weird</a>.

I take it that this is petty much the dynamic of every argument against significant moral progress ever...
<blockquote>The intensity and popularity of <em>our</em> prejudices establish that they cannot be wrong. Strange people willing to entertain the possibility that our prejudices may actually be wildly contingent, harmful, and immoral demonstrate by that very willingness that they are moral autistics blind the rich, embodied ties of sentiment that hold real communities together. Thankfully, there is no point listening to moral retards who reject moral lives as we live them. If they had their way, they'd destroy everything. Talk of the welfare of <em>those </em>people is simply beside the point. We don't have to pay attention to <em>them </em>because, well, because we <em>don't </em>pay attention to them. And that's how we live. Which is obviously better than the alternatives, or else we wouldn't be living this way!</blockquote>
Anyway, if I were capable of formulating claims with actual cognitive content, my argument would be that the welfare of many millions of people around the world would be significantly improved if nations reduced restrictions on movement across their borders and if wealthier nations especially implemented large guest worker programs. I maintain additionally  that these policies are more likely to improve than harm the well-being of incumbent members of rich societies. There are two main ways to actually rebut these arguments. First, by showing that they are empirically false. But I think the evidence is strongly on my side. I will be attempting to show this in detail in the future. Second, by showing that it is permissible to be indifferent to the well-being of millions of people, or that some competing value, such as living the way a few of us are used to living, outweighs huge welfare gains to millions of people. I don't think this is a winning strategy, either. Now, it is also possible to avoid engaging an argument by ignoring it -- perhaps by ruling that people who make it are ineligible for serious consideration by virtue of the very fact that they have made it.

Anyway, it's very useful to know what you're up against.
