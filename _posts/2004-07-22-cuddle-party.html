Does the DEA know that <a href="http://www.oxytocin.org/oxytoc/love-science.html">oxytocin</a> is addictive?

934 Westminster is <b>so</b> having a <a href="http://www.cuddleparty.com/">cuddle party</a>! The rules:

<blockquote>1. Pajamas stay on the whole time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>2. No SEX. (Yep, you read that right.)</blockquote>
<blockquote>3. Ask for permission to kiss or nuzzle anyone. Make sure you can handle getting a no before you invite or request anyone to cuddle or kiss.</blockquote>
<blockquote>4. If you're a yes, say yes. If you're a no, say no.</blockquote>
<blockquote>5. If you're a maybe, say NO.</blockquote>
<blockquote>6. You are encouraged to change your mind from a yes to a no, no to a yes anytime you want.</blockquote>
<blockquote>7. NO DRY HUMPING!</blockquote>
<blockquote>8. Communicate, communicate, communicate.</blockquote>
<blockquote>9. If you're in a relationship, communicate and set your boundaries and agreements BEFORE you go to the Cuddle Party. Don't re-negotiate those agreements/boundaries during the Cuddle Party. (Trust us on this one.)</blockquote>
<blockquote>10. Get your Cuddle Life Guard On Duty or Cuddle Caddy if there's a concern, problem, or question or should you feel unsafe or need assistance with anything during the Cuddle Party.</blockquote>
<blockquote>11. Crying and giggling are both welcomed and encouraged.</blockquote>
<blockquote>12. Outside of your personal relationships, it's nobody's business who you cuddle, so please be respectful of other people's privacy when sharing with the outside world about Cuddle Parties.</blockquote>
<blockquote>13. Arrive on time.</blockquote>
<blockquote>14. Be hygienically savvy.</blockquote>
<blockquote>15. Clean up after yourself.</blockquote>
<blockquote>16. Always say thank you and practice good Cuddle Manners.</blockquote>

My guess is that any party where you have to emphatically proscribe dry humping is a party in which there <em>will be some dry humping</em>.

Objectivist bonus: CuddleParty.com is apparently the copyright of an entity named "Atlas Spooned." Which makes me think: If Rearden would have just taken some of his seeting psychosexual frustration and just <em>cuddled</em> with Dagny . . . I mean, jammies stay on, and they just <em>spoon</em>. I think our Promethean giants of industry might have been a lot less stressed out about all the parasites, moochers, and whim-worhsipping second handers, and everything would have turned out a lot nicer for everybody. Rural Colorado gets pretty boring after awhile.

Want to know some words I learned from Ayn Rand: <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bromide&r=67">bromide</a>; <a href="http://">instransigent</a>.
