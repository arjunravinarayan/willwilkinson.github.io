In this week's Free Will, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/11164">I chat with Jeff Sharlet</a>, author of the shocking new book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060559799?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0060559799&amp;adid=10SZ7ARAXA49MZSTXAQ3&amp;">The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power</a>. </em>I'm prone to skepticism about shadowy cabals, but I found this book both believable and upsetting. Jeff (a contributing editor to <em>Harpers</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>) was apparently a bit worried about talking to a Cato suit, but it <a href="http://www.therevealer.org/archives/main_story_003028.php">seems to have turned out okay</a>:
<blockquote>When Bloggingheads TV, the website that produces those video "diavlogs" you see these days in the fold of the online<em> NYT</em>, told me they'd given my new book, <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Secret-Fundamentalism-Heart-American/dp/0060559799/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1211180667&amp;sr=8-1">The Family</a></em></strong>, to Will Wilkinson of the conservative libertarian Cato Institute , I was a little concerned. The elite fundamentalists about whom I write are particularly passionate about what some call "biblical capitalism," a literally religious devotion to free markets. Wilkinson, as you can imagine, is a big believer in free markets, too, and for that reason I thought he and I might have a very contentious conversation.

Oh me of little faith in the wisdom of Bloggingheads. Wilkinson turned out to be an ideal respondent -- indeed, he may have understood aspects of the book better than I did when I wrote it. Most importantly, he recognized that biblical capitalism uses the veneer of free markets as a cover for the cronyism of the anointed. It's dishonest libertarianism, "self-interest by proxy," in Wilkinson's brilliant phrase -- the exact opposite of the responsible, transparent libertarianism championed by Wilkinson.</blockquote>
I'm glad that came across!
