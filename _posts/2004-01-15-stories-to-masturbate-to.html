-- I'm proud to report that the Fly Bottle is #2 <a href="http://aolsearch.aol.com/aol/search?invocationType=topsearchbox.%2Faol%2Fjsp%2Fsearch.jsp&query=stories+to+masurbate+to">in this search</a> on AOL, just after "<a href="http://www.sprinklesgold.com/stories/d3.html">A Special Weekend</a>" by D. at  Spinkle's Golden Showers!  [WARNING: For the love of sweet Jesus DO NOT READ "A Special Weekend" by D. at Sprinkle's Golden Showers!!! Just don't.]

[To National Review Readers: Sorry about this, didn't know you were coming. I repeat: DO NOT READ THE STORY. I mean it.]
