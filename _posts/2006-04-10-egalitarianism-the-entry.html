I had forgotten, until just now, that I wrote the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Egalitarianism&direction=next&oldid=80280">original Wikipedia entry</a> for "egalitarianism" way back in 2001. How's that for Internet philosophy geek cred?! It's pretty interesting to see that though there have been about 500 edits, the conceptual framing of my original mostly remains, along with a good bit of the original boring prose. Yay path dependency!
My first try could have been more rousing. But I give myself credit for not simply writing "First!"
