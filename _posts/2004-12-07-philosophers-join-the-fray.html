<a href="http://left2right.typepad.com/main/">Left2Right</a>, a new group blog by a bunch of incredibly distinguished moral and political philosophers (I was surprised to receive a promotional email from David Velleman), promises to be interesting reading and a prime source of good blogging material. The mission of the blog is to think out loud about how the left can better communicate to the right. Judging from the first few posts, it seems that we will be treated to a good deal of armchair sociology from smart philosophers, which is always amusing. It will, I fear, tell us more about how professional academics conceptualize the right than anything particularly useful and true about how to engage the right. Nevertheless, I'm glad to see that the faculty lounge of a fantasy political philosophy department is open to the public.
