The mysterious, nameless Free Exchange editor has asked me if I have some thoughts about Matt Yglesias's ruminations on the ethics of deficits. It turns out that I do! Matt says:
<blockquote><a href="http://www.ppionline.org/ppi_ci.cfm?knlgAreaID=125&amp;subsecid=162&amp;contentid=254284"><font color="#335c85">The objection</font></a> that deficits "place an unfair financial burden on future generations" doesn't make a ton of sense. Think about an individual taking out a large loan for some reason or other -- a mortgage to buy a house, say. This may be a prudent investment, or it may be a foolish one. Whether or not the loan amounts to an "unfair financial burden" on future versions of yourself isn't an <em>additional issue</em> on top of the issue of how well your investment performs.</blockquote>
I don't have a big beef against running up deficits now and then, but I do think there are good reasons of political economy to prefer more or less balanced budgets financed with more or less current taxation. Matt is right that debt can make sense. But the first thing to remember is that the state is <em>not</em> an individual, and is not even remotely <em>like </em>and individual (this <em>does </em>need saying), and the second thing to remember is that the fact that the state is <em>able</em> to take money from one set of people and transfer it to another always and everywhere <em>does </em>create patterns of behavior in which some groups of people <em>in fact</em> take money from others' and transfer it to themselves. When we know in advance that strategic redistributive shenanigans <em>are</em> going to happen, we can try to design our fiscal institutions to minimize them.

Now, I don't know the state of the art on the Ricardo-Barro equivalence theorem, which basically says that there is no economic difference in the long run between tax and debt financing, but I doubt it for pretty much the reasons provided by Buchanan and Wagner in <em>Democracy in Deficit</em>:
<blockquote>Consider the combination of pressures that will be brought to bear on the elected politicians who must represent all age groups. Will these pressures, to which we predict the politician to respond, suggest that he opt for more, the same, or less public spending under unbalanced budgets than under balanced budgets? The answer seems clear. To the younger members of his constituency, there will be, in the limit, no pressures for differentiation. Their preferred levels of budgetary outlay will remain unchanged as debt is substituted for current taxation, provided, of course, we stay within the strict confines of the full-information model here. The older members of the politician's constituency will, however, clearly express a bias toward higher levels of spending under the debt alternative. The one group is, in the limit, neutral; the other has a rationally motivated directional bias. The net pressures on the politicians clearly tend toward expanded spending, with the "unrepresented" being those yet-unfranchised future taxpayers who must bear the liabilities chosen by their ancestors.</blockquote>
Given a choice between a bunch of consumption you don't have to pay for, and a bunch of consumption you do have to pay for, we should expect people to not want to pay, other things equal.  Add to this Sala-i-Martin and Mulligan's work on "gerontocracy," which explains why it is that the old people get what they want -- the retired have both a lower opportunity cost to political action and are better able to coordinate as a massive unified interest, while finely divided occupational and industrial interest groups are both smaller and tend to offset each other <em>-- and </em>the demographic fact that the ratio of retirees to workers in increasing, and you've got yourself a pretty strong argument for why we should expect undisciplined deficit spending -- why we should expect old people to transfer money from future taxpayers to themselves.

If we're expecting our vast, debt-biased retired cohorts to demand high levels of spending on "growth-enhancing public sector investments," then, as Matt points out, there may be no net redistribution from the future to the present at all. But since old people are tend to enjoy the benefits of growth the least, we shouldn't expect them to lobby for this kind of "investment." Instead, we should expect them to lobby for stuff they can consume before they die, like prescription drug benefits, ever-more lavishly subsidized health care, and other "quality of life" initiatives, like express lanes for Winnebagos and government subsidies for the production of new episodes of Murder, She Wrote.

Now, like Matt, I don't think there is any <em>special  </em>ethical issue here. Public spending ought to provide for public goods, not for the private consumption of some people at the expense of others. The issue is the same whether the transfer takes place between concurrent taxpayers and tax consumers, or between current tax consumers and future taxpayers. We should, however, recognize that there is a structural bias in the political system toward intertemporal transfers, and seek to erect institutions, like balanced budget rules, that help mitigate the harm. But the moral problem with deficit spending isn't that the transfer is intertemporal. The problem is that it is an exploitative <em>transfer </em>and not legitimate<em> public</em> spending.<em> </em>
