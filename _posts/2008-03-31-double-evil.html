From the <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/blog/lewrw/archives/020296.html">always lovable Lew Rockwell</a>:
<blockquote>Is everything evil along the DC subway's Orange Line? Well, no, but they all work for the regime, or are the regime, as Former Beltway Wonk <a href="http://formerbeltwaywonk.wordpress.com/2008/01/21/my-anti-blogroll/">points out</a>. Here's his list: American Prospect; Andrew Sullivan; BATF, CATO, Homeland Security, Federal Reserve; FDA; IRS; IMF; Marginal Revolution; Matthew Yglesias; Megan McCardle; New Republic; OSHA; Pentagon (very close); Reason Magazine; State Department; Treasury Department; Volokh Conspiracy; White House; Will Wilkinson.</blockquote>
I am very flattered to be considered evil independent of the evil that is Cato, but, as I keep insisting, I live on the Green Line.

Anyway, the narcissism of small differences.
