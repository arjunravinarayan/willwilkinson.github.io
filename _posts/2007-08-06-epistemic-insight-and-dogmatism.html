Over at his new Overcoming Bias blog, Robin Hanson has a fascinating post about the terrifying prospect of disagreeing with the late, much-lamented David Lewis, and Peter van Inwagen's (no slouch he) idea that perhaps his disagreements with Lewis about compatibilism, personhood, and modality might be accounted for by his greater insight, if not intelligence.
<blockquote>I suppose my best guess is that I enjoy some sort of philosophical insight (I mean in relation to these three particular theses) that, for all his merits, is somehow denied to Lewis. And this would have to be an insight that is incommunicable - -at least I don't know how to communicate it--, for I have done all I can to communicate it to Lewis, and he has understood perfectly everything I have said, and he has not come to share my conclusions.</blockquote>
I actually think there is something to van Inwagen's claim, and don't think it is necessarily  a form of bias. But obviously the "insight" view has the danger of justifying dogmatism, and needs to be spelled out better.

Thanksgiving night, under the influence of tryptophan, red wine, sleep-deprivation, and no doubt other influences on consciousness and cognition, I had a kind of insight about this kind of insight. It occurred to me that although I like to cook, enjoy good food, and have a fairly discriminating palate, able to tell the difference between very good and very very good food, I'm just not very passionate about it. I like to cook not because I anticipate the deliciousness of the meal, but because I like the satisfaction of having gotten it "right." The quality of the gustatory experience is secondary, and of mainly evidential value to me. It occurred to me, however, that I <em>am</em> passionate about truth, but not <em>per se</em>, with a Socratic kind of <em>philosophia</em>. I can't say I have a love for truth so much as a <em>taste </em>for it. But this doesn't seem to get the emphasis right, either. My taste for truth is somewhat negative. I have a sense of <em>disgust </em>for falsehood. It gives me a sense of uneasiness and agitation, which moves me to try to eliminate it. The sense of arriving at a correct answer is not so much a sense of enjoyment but a sense of relief, like having rinsed one's mouth of a bitter taste.

Now, I don't think that I am super-intelligent, but I think my self-conception is that I have a fairly refined epistemic palate that even people much smarter--that is, with greater reliable computational power--than me often lack. An expert wine-taster can discriminate the subtle notes in a wine. And I like to think I can sense the almost undetectable bitterness of error in a complex argument. This is, of course, terribly, embarrasingly self-aggrandizing, and a great manifestation of a kind of over-confidence bias. I think what sometimes saves me from myself (<em>sometimes</em>)<em> </em>is that as I learn more, my palate improves, and I find I can never quite root out the bitterness. It is there, more subtle than before, but there, assuring me I have not yet got things right. Eventually, arrogrance produces humility.

Now, I can't see why there shouldn't be something like epistemic taste, akin to aesthetic taste, moral sensibility, or connoiseurship. I am a huge fan of Hume's essay on taste, and I think that refinement of sensibility does allow people to make judgments that track objective features of the world more reliably than those less refined. Like the aficionado who can immediately discern that there was a rusted iron key in a barrel of wine, a epistemic aficionado can discern the vulgar falsehood in bad arguments. For example, I feel this way about utilitarianism and many anti-market arguments: "You can't <em>taste </em>the rusted iron?" You get the bitterness in the fallacy before you can fully articulate it. The aversion to falsity motivates the attempt to articulate it, to rinse out the sense of epistemic contamination. But no matter how well one articulates it, others have to sense the truth in it to also accept it. We have to accept that this won't and often can't happen. At a high level of abstraction or complexity -- when it comes to issues like the immensely tricky ones van Inwagen mentions -- there may be no way to articulate reasons in a way that suits everyone's epistemic taste, even those who are also connossieurs.

There is a right answer about which wines are good and not-so-good, even if many or even most people can't tell the difference. But there may be no answer about which wine is the <em>best</em> one. By contrast, unless the formulation of the problem involves some kind of fundamental confusion (I suspect both Lewis and van Inwagen's views on modality reflect such a confusion.
