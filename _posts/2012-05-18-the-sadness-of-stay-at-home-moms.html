<blockquote>Stay-at-home moms fare worse than employed moms at every income level in terms of sadness, anger, and depression. On the other items Gallup measures -- laughter, enjoyment, happiness, worry, stress, learning something interesting, and having a high life evaluation rating -- middle- and high-income stay-at-home moms for the most part do as well as employed moms.

However, low-income stay-at-home moms do worse on all of these items than their employed counterparts. These moms -- with annual household incomes of less than $36,000 -- are less likely than employed moms at this income level to say they smiled or laughed a lot or experienced happiness or enjoyment "yesterday." They are also slightly less likely to say they learned something interesting.</blockquote>
