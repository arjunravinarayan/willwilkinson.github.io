From a <a href="http://www.freeliberal.com/archives/001968.html">good post by Michael Strong</a>:
<blockquote>Martin Seligman, author of <em>Learned Optimism</em>, is the national leader of the positive psychology movement.  I recently ran across Martin Seligman's "<a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb98/pres.html">Presidential Column</a>," when, in his capacity as president of the American Psychological Association, he describes a decision by the American Psychiatric Association as "shameful." The context was the psychiatrists' decision not to participate in a joint academic journal designed to facilitate communication and share research findings between the psychological community and the psychiatric community. Seligman's account of the demise of this journal is telling:</blockquote>
<blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>"We published our first article and commentary in September 1997. You can read it on the web at http://www.journals.apa.org/treatment.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The dream has ended. In December 1997 the American Psychiatric Association’s Board of Trustees, acting in a closed-door meeting, withdrew from the collaboration (see article on page 42). They cited the need for a “broad review of the costs and benefits of electronic publishing projects.” This, of course, was not the whole story.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In August I began getting messages from their leadership that their board, led by the California trustees, might end their participation. In September, they put their cooperation on hold, citing the “state of the relationship between the two associations.” I was informed that APA’s policy of seeking prescription privileges for psychologists was the central problem. What publishing this scholarly journal had to do with that issue was not clear, but we crafted a disclaimer that reading Treatment did not qualify one to prescribe. It was clear, however, that their final decision to end the collaboration was political. Many of their trustees were worried that any collaboration with APA would legitimize the efforts of psychologists to obtain prescription privileges."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Both the psychiatric and psychological guilds would be outraged by my notion that we need to legalize markets in happiness and well-being, especially once they realized that that would involve the elimination of occupational licensure. Guilds exist to protect legal prerogatives.</blockquote>
Amazing!  I like Michael's phrase "legalize markets in happiness and well-being." And guilds disgust me.
