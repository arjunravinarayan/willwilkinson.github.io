INSTITUTIONS matter. To economic performance, that is. If not a consensus view, it is by now a widespread view. One of the fundamental obstacles to the institutionalist view is that no one is sure precisely what an institution <span style="font-style: italic">is. </span><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/10/clark_gives_gre_1.html">Arnold Kling points us</a> to Gregory Clark's <a href="http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/book_reviews/Greif-JEL.pdf">review</a> of Avner Greif's important book "Institutions and the Path to the Modern Economy":
<blockquote>In chapter 2, Greif lays out a formal definition of an institution. This is, “An institution is a system of rules, beliefs, norms and organizations that together generate a regularity of (social) behavior” ... Each of the component terms in the definition—“rules,” “beliefs,” “norms,” “organizations,” “regularity,” “behavior”—is itself a loosely defined ordinary language term. We do not get clarity by defining one ambiguous concept in terms of six others equally ambiguous.</blockquote>
I suspect Mr Clark is playing dumb for effect. He is notoriously harsh on the institutionalists. But does he really not know what a belief is? I'll help: A belief is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_attitude">propositional attitude</a> with a mind-to-world <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_of_fit">direction of fit</a>. That may seem obscure, but that's really the answer. Likewise, I assume Mr Clark does not expect his colleagues in the UC Davis economics department to suddenly begin greeting him with farts and whistles instead of handshakes, and therefore we may assume that he understands full well what a regularity and is -- perhaps even a norm.

According to Mr Clark's review, Mr Greif's definition is both broad and too narrow. With respect to over-broadness, Mr Clark says that the medieval Japanese fastidiously bathed, while the filthy English  almost never did. But these norm-driven regularities in behaviour don't seem like institutions in the relevant sense. I agree. But this suggests refinement, not abandonment of the definition. The engine of Mr Greif's work is game theory -- the logic of interdependent or strategic behaviour. (We know what behaviour is, right?) A socially widespread custom may indeed lead to regularities in individual behavior, but have no important function in the co-ordination of behavior. By regularities of specifically <em>social </em>behavior, Mr Greif seems to have in mind regularities in interdependent action -- if you do this, then I'll do that -- especially ones that affect the loss from conflict or the surplus from co-operation. Perhaps as a matter of usage, it would be better not to call the systems of convention underlying strategic regularities "institutions", but it's hard to see why they should not be considered central to any account of why some groups of people build wealth while others do not.

In the end, the issue seems to comes down to Mr Clark's squeamishness about the not-easily quantifiable. Mr Clark has had it once Mr Greif insists on amending the usual rational actor assumptions with things like "cognitive norms", "fairness", and "losses of esteem".
<blockquote>Once we are compelled to admit, however, into the explanatory apparatus almost the entire sociological zoo of ill defined and unmeasurable constructs, we lose all explanatory power. Explanatory power requires few objects and small degrees of freedom.</blockquote>
This strikes me as so much disciplinary conservatism (and chauvinism). In my opinion, the only science that could provide a satisfactory account of the sources of economic growth is something like a well-developed "cognitive economic anthropology". Sadly, it does not exist. The fact that Greif is proposing something like it, even if he is himself able to make only a partial and imperfect assay, is a merit, not a drawback of his approach. He is pushing a frontier opened by Douglass North and other far-sighted economists who have convincingly made the case for a modicum of empiricism about the actual mechanisms of economic behavior. Yes, it is messy down there in the minds of real men and women. So much shame and indignation. So little clean-lined maximisation. But that's what we're dealing with. It's a shopworn trope, but Mr Clark sounds to me here a bit like the drunk insisting that we look for his lost keys under the streetlamp, because the light is better there. Like Mr Greif, I'd rather feel around where the answers are, even if that leaves us half in the dark.
So broadly in fact, that it the definition may be somewhat vacuous, but I don't think it's right to say that we can't even understand what his notion of an institution is. If an institution is "that which generates regularities of social behavior," then it may not seem extremely enlightening to find that different institutions generate different regularities, and that different regularities generate different economic results. But it may well be extremely enlightening if it is possible to specify the particular rules, beliefs, norms, etc., that are responsible for wealth-creating regularities. This, I take it, is what Mr Greif is attempts to do.
