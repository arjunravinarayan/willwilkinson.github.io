Responding to my post on religion and happiness Ross Douthat writes:
<blockquote>But my suspicion is that the difference has something to do with the role of the welfare state as well - that the benefits of belonging to a religious community are greater in the U.S. than in Europe in part because our welfare state is smaller, and religious participation provides both tangible and intangible forms of security that are more valuable in a society where the free market is more freewheeling and the welfare state weaker. If you're a Christian who prefers the American model, you might say that the Europeans use government as a substitute for God; if you prefer Europe's path to modernity, you'd probably say something about Americans clinging to churchgoing because it's the only protection available against the harsh brutality of our jungle capitalism. Either way, I suspect that this symbiosis between high levels of religiosity and economic individualism is at the heart of American exceptionalism - which is another way of saying that libertarians root for secularization at their peril.</blockquote>
I think there's a lot to what Ross is saying here. That European secularization is a consequence of the welfare state replacing religion in providing a social safety net is more or less the hypothesis of the book by Norris and Inglehart linked below. But I don't feel imperiled rooting for secularization, probably because I'm not a very doctrinaire libertarian. The non-ex-communist European countries that are most fully secularized, the Scandinavians, are also among the most economically liberal.
