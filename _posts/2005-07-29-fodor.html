One of the most terrifying experiences I can imagine is having a book I have written reviewed by Jerry Fodor. Thankfully, Buller comes out all right in Fodor's TLS review of <em>Adapting Minds</em>, largely because Fodor is going to be sympathetic to anything that lays into ev psych orthodoxy. He complains, however, that Buller is not a good nativist, and won't just abandon the project of Darwinian psychology. The review turns out to be a general attack on evolutionary approaches to the mind that is about as convincing as a brief for Intelligent Design. Fodor fixates on what he calls "the problem of unattached motives." He starts out very poorly, indeed:

<em>It’s more of a problem – and Buller is quite clear on this – that an Adaptationist account of Jones’s behaviour may need to appeal to a motive that explains his action but that Jones didn’t actually have; not consciously, not unconsciously, not at all. It’s a main tenet of psychological Darwinism that the “ultimate” motivation for an adaptive behaviour is to maximize one’s relative contribution to the genetic endowment of one’s breeding group. So (still assuming it’s an adaptation) what Buller calls the “proximal” cause of Jones’s behaviour is that he wants (maybe consciously, maybe not) not to catch his death of cold and he believes (maybe consciously, maybe not) that he won’t catch his death of cold if he doesn’t get wet. But the “ultimate” cause of his behaviour is his wanting to maximize his contribution to the gene pool of his breeding group, which requires, inter alia, that he not be dead. That, to repeat, is what Jones really wants, assuming that his umbrella-carrying behaviour is an adaptation; and it’s what his ancestors were selected for wanting in the old days back on the savannah. The trouble is, of course, that Jones wants no such thing – not consciously or unconsciously either. Jones may never have so much as heard about breeding groups; his ancestors certainly never did.</blockquote>

Buller here agrees with Fodor. In this paper, he shows, pretty conclusively to my mind, why it is wrong to think of inclusive fitness as any kind of ultimate psychological goal--what we "really," ultimately want. Traits that maximize inclusive fitness are selected for. That's all. If I want to eat sweet things, it's not that I really want inclusive fitness. It is just that wanting to eat sweet things maximizes inclusive fitness, and that's why I have the capacity and tendency to want to eat sweet things. The ultimate psychological explanation of why I ate the fudge is that I want to eat sweets. Period. The further biological explanation of my psychological capacities and dispositions is not part of the explanation of my behavior, and more than the the further chemical explanation of the structure of DNA is part of the biological explanation of why tigers have pointy teeth.
