I'm just thrilled that Thomas Schelling will share with Robert Aumann a piece of this year's Nobel Prize in economics. I had the opportunity to meet Schelling at a <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/article.php/367.html">conference on self-deception</a> I helped organize for Mercatus. I believe he may well be the most astonishingly articulate person I've ever heard speak. But more important, Schelling is a profound and creative thinker. He deserves to be your intellectual hero. I don't think I truly <em>understood</em> the idea of coordination until I read Schelling's elegant, imaginative, and lucid explanations.

Here is Schelling's 1982 Tanner Lecture, "<a href="http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/schelling83.pdf">Ethics, Law, and the Excercise of Self-Command</a>," which you can also find in his collection of essays <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;tag=theflybottle-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0674127714?v=glance">Choice and Consequence</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=theflybottle-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />  (along with the <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/10/schelling_and_a_1.html">Tyler-recommended</a> "The Mind as a Consuming Organ.") I know of no other economist who writes better prose, or is who is more authentically wise. Big props to the Swedes.
