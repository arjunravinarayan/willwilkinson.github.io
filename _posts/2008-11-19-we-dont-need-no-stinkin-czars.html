Such is the theme of this morning's Marketplace commentary.

<script type="text/javascript" src="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/www_publicradio/tools/media_player/js/swfobject.js"></script><div id="marketplace/morning_report/2008/11/19/marketplace_morning_report0450_20081119_64s_player"></div><script language="javascript">/*< ![CDATA[*/var so = new SWFObject("http://marketplace.publicradio.org/www_publicradio/tools/media_player/s_player.swf", "marketplace/morning_report/2008/11/19/marketplace_morning_report0450_20081119_64s_player", "319", "83", "8", "#ffffff");so.addParam("quality", "high");so.addParam("menu", "false");so.addParam("wmode", "transparent");so.addVariable("name", "marketplace/morning_report/2008/11/19/marketplace_morning_report0450_20081119_64");so.addVariable("starttime", "00:00:00:0");so.addVariable("endtime", "00:00:00:0");so.write("marketplace/morning_report/2008/11/19/marketplace_morning_report0450_20081119_64s_player");/*]]>*/</script>

The beginning of my concluding paragraph was cut, which is too bad since I thought it was the most important part. It originally ended like this:

<blockquote><em>More importantly, a czarstruck public becomes all-too-willing to think that without a Hunger Czar, bellies will go unfilled, that without an Office of Homeland Happiness, there will be no mirth in the land. But government is not our source of sustenance and happiness. </em>And Czars are more often than not a cosmetic response to problems government policy itself has created. Politicians promise much, but government too rarely delivers. In the end, it is the innovation and enterprise of private citizens, not a swarm of pint-sized Caesars, that delivers the goods.</blockquote>
