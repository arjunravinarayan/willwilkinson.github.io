I've promised 3 blog posts per day through November, and the first 5 days are free. (GIVE NOW AND WE WILL MEET OUR FUNDRAISING GOALS!) Just a word on how I'm counting. A day = from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed. So a post at, say, 3 am tomorrow morning would count for today. It's obviously extremely easy to post 3 times a day, but I don't intend to cheat. My intention is that at least one of those be intellectually substantive, or if not that, then gratifyingly amusing. I'm off to an election day party this evening, and I hope to post something drunkenly from the site of our festivities, which may be amusing. I'm good at drunk typing!
