<blockquote>While we’re on the subject of war, though, isn’t that the elephant in the room here? I mean, I’m not a tenth the social liberal that Will is, nor am I an open borders devotee, etc. etc., but the fact remains that I wouldn’t <em>think</em> of supporting the GOP so long as it remains the party of bloated defense budgets, unapologetic support for the Iraq war, and bomb bomb bomb, bomb bomb Iran, not to mention freedom fries, FISA, the PATRIOT Act, torture, and the rest. <em>That’s</em> statism, my friends, and if <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Y2QwOTYyN2Y3NGNmZWI5MGZkNWJmOTBjNzdhYjE3NGU=">Jonah Goldberg</a> really can’t see why a committed libertarian might regard such a party as a lost cause to be jettisoned in favor of an admittedly unattractive other, then he clearly needs to think things through again.</blockquote>
