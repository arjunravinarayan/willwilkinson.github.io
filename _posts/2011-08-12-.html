TITLE TK

“Hold on a second. <em>Hold on a second</em> and I’ll let you speak,” a perturbed Mitt Romney implored maybe a little too emphatically into his microphone. It was a few minutes shy of 11:00 am on a bright Thursday morning at the Iowa State Fair. Romney’s energetic stump speech had gone smoothly. The idea was Barack Obama is ruining the economy and Mitt Romney is the man to fix it. The attentive crowd of Iowans seemed receptive to this idea. But things had taken a rancorous turn. The Q&amp;A was going to hell.

“Scrap the cap! Scrap the cap! Scrap the cap!” a handful of folks seated on the hay bales directly in front of the “speaker’s soapbox” stage chanted and clapped. Behind them, Joe Fagan, a retired community organizer in a floppy green hat, tried to shout something about Social Security over the general cacophony while making an emphatic tomahawk chopping motion with his left arm. A small woman in a Romney campaign volunteer t-shirt, agitated by this breech of civic decorum, advanced furiously on Fagan, thrusting her finger, yelling an invitation to stand down.

“Just let him talk. Let him talk. Go ahead,” Romney said, apparently reconciled to the immutable reality of a successfully hijacked Q&amp;A session. The crowd simmered down to a burble of mild dismay. Joe Fagan re-shouted his question, “What are you going to do to strengthen Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid without cutting benefits?” still chopping the air in nervously excited outrage.

“You ready for my answer?” Romney replied with an edge of sarcastic aggression, leaning forward over a bent knee, his foot now propped manfully on a bale of hay. “I’m not going to raise taxes! That’s my answer. I’m not going to raise taxes.” Romney’s annoyed voice was raised slightly more than necessary for a man in full command of an outdoor public address system. “And if you want somebody who’s going to raise taxes, you can vote for Barack Obama!”

"What organizers love is the experience of confronting power,” Joe Fagan told the <em>Des Moines Register</em> <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20100718/OPINION01/7180309/Basu-Joe-Fagan-force-activism">in a profile last year</a>. “The adrenaline flows." Fagan was one of about a dozen volunteers/activists affiliated with the Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, a progressive group based in Des Moines dedicated to “social, economic, and environmental justice,” who stationed themselves directly in front of the “speaker’s soapbox” to confront the power that is Mitt Romney, the super-wealthy ex-governor of Massachusetts who is now leading the pack in the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.

"Sometimes you've gotta do things to get noticed, and to get the other side to negotiate," Fagan told the <em>Register</em> by way of defending his group’s sometimes disruptive tactics. ICCI didn’t get Mitt Romney to negotiate on “scrapping the cap”—on voiding the rule that exempts income above XXXX from the Social Security payroll tax. But it did goad Romney into uttering “corporations are people,” unleashing a brief flood of indignant liberal tweets and putting conservatives on the logic-chopping defensive.

Romney was laying out the options for ensuring that Medicare and Social Security remain “promises we can keep.” Referring back to the chanted demand to “scrap the cap,” Romney began his menu of choices: “One is raising taxes on people…” Those who had come to confront power immediately began yelling “<em>Corporations</em>!” as though it had suddenly occurred to them that raising payroll taxes might not be necessary after all. Corporations! Tax <em>those</em>. A less rattled Romney might have observed that to “scrap the cap” is to raise taxes on a certain set of relatively well-paid people. He might have asked his vocal interlocutors if he was mistaken to think that was their idea.  Instead, he said, with a note of sneering condescension, “Corporations are people, my friend.” When a mocking laugh went up, Romney clarified, “Of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people.” More mocking laughs. “Where do you <em>think</em> it goes?”

Shouts: “Pockets!” “Into their pockets!” “Pockets!”

“Into <em>whose </em>pockets? People’s pockets. Human beings, my friend.”

<em>My friend</em>.

Thursday’s fraught exchange exposed more than one weakness in Romney the candidate. He wasn’t wrong that taxes on corporations are ultimately borne by people, but that’s beside the point. He erred, first, in allowing semi-pro agitators to lure him into an exchange about corporations when he should have had the presence of mind to calmly clarify that to increase or eliminate the cap on the payroll tax is just what he said it is: to raise taxes on people. He erred, second, in appearing all-too-ready to fly to the defense of corporations. Finally, he ought to have known that, since the <em>Citizens United</em> decision especially, many progressives are almost lunatic with outrage over the idea that corporations are legal “persons” with certain rights. He just unwittingly volunteered himself as villain in the left’s favorite morality play.

Barack Obama has been a disappointment to the left. He’s doubled down on George W. Bush’s imperialist, civil-liberties-shredding war on terror. He negotiates with tea-party terrorists and loses. Obama no longer inspires the old white hot love. Mostly, the hope is gone.

When Romney said, “corporations are people,” he wasn’t trying to make some lawyerly point about legal personality, but it doesn’t really matter what he was trying to say. The kerfuffle at the fair didn’t hurt Romney in the eyes of Republicans. On the contrary, the Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement really were rude, self-righteous, and annoying. A number of Iowa citizens in the crowd, equally concerned with community improvement, I’m sure, told me they quite liked the way Romney handled the “hecklers.” “Corporations are people” doesn’t mean much to them. But it doesn’t have to. Those words emanating from that well-coiffed venture-capitalist head helps make Romney the callous, plutocrat cartoon a demoralized left needs the Republican nominee to be.
