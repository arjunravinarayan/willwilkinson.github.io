I couldn't say it better, so I'm just going to cut &amp; paste <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2009/01/22/yes-he-did/">the entirety of Radley Balko's post</a>:
<blockquote>Credit where it’s due: Well done, Mr. Obama. I’m sure we’ll have our differences, but afer your first 40+ hours on the job, this libertarian couldn’t be happier.

The tally:
	<li> Obama <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/01/61744636/1" target="_blank">rescinded Bush’s 2001 executive order</a> allowing former presidents, vice presidents, and their heirs to claim executive privilege in determining which of their records get released to the public. Even better, he’s requiring the signature of both his White House counsel and the attorney general before <em>he</em> can classify a document under executive privilege.</li>
	<li><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/washingtonpostinvestigations/2009/01/obama_orders_government_record.html?wprss=washingtonpostinvestigations" target="_blank">Issued a memorandum</a> to all executive agencies asking them to come up with a new plan for open government and complying with FOIA requests. He is also instructing three top officials, including the U.S. attorney general, to come up with a new policy on open government. The new policy would replace the existing policy, infamously set by a 2001 memo from John Ashcroft that instructed federal agencies to essentially to take every measure they can to refuse FOIA requests.</li>
	<li><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090121/ap_on_go_pr_wh/obama_executive_pay" target="_blank">Put a freeze</a> on the salaries of top White House aides.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/01/21/ST2009012104276.html" target="_blank">Suspended the military trials</a> at Gitmo, and is expected to issue an order closing Gitmo as soon as today.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/obama/1391326,CST-NWS-foi22web.article" target="_blank">Said this</a>:
<blockquote>“For a long time now there has been too much secrecy in this city. The old rules said that if there was a defensible argument for not disclosing something to the American people, then it should not be disclosed. That era is now over. Starting today, every agency and department should know that this administration stands on the side not of those who seek to withhold information, but those who seek to make it known.

The mere fact that you have the legal power to keep something secret does not mean you should use it. The Freedom of Information Act is perhaps the most powerful instrument we have for making our government honest and transparent and holding it accountable. I expect my administration not only to live up to the letter but the spirit of this law.”</blockquote>
Yes, it’s only been one day. But this is mighty impressive. Obama’s top priority upon taking office was to sign orders rolling back his predecessor’s expansion of executive power. Put another way, Obama’s top priority upon taking office was to institute <em>limits</em> on his own power.</li>
That’s something even a cynic like me can celebrate.</blockquote>
This is all fantastic news, and a great relief. This is change I can believe in, in fact.
