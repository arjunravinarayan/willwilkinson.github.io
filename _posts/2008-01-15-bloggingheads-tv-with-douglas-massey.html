Speaking of structural barriers to the exercise of liberty, <a href="http://www.bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/8065">here I am talking with Princeton sociologist Douglas Massey</a> about his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Categorically-Unequal-American-Stratification-System/dp/0871545853"><em>Categorically Unequal: The American Stratification System</em></a>. If you think serious racial discrimination has dried up these days, try Chapter 3: "Reworking the Color Line." It's full of evidence of continuing labor market and housing discrimination, and is one of the the most depressing things I've read in a while.Â  I disagree with a good bit of what Massey takes to be the upshot of all this in his book, but I was glad we were able to find so much to agree about it in our chat.
