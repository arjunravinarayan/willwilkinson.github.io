-- Dont forget that tonight is Ban the Bans first event, a pub crawl through Adams Morgan. Be sure to tell all your friends who are interested in fighting the smoking ban. And wear your red, white, and black!

If you cant make it for the whole thing, heres where well be:

    * 7:30 pm - meet at the SW corner of 18th and Columbia.
    * 7:45-8:45 pm - Millie and Als
    * 9:00-9:45 pm - Tryst
    * 10:00-10:45pm - Angry Inch
    * 11:00-11:45am - Brass Monkey
    * 12:00- ?? - Peyote Cafe

We'll be the contingent in Ban the Ban T-Shirts, or red, white, and black (ANARCHY!) If you can't find us, give me ring at the number below.
