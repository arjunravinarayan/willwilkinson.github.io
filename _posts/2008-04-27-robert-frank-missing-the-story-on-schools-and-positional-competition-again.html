I've been complaining <a href="http://www.cis.org.au/POLICY/spring_06/polspring06_wilkinson.htm">for a while now</a> about Robert Frank's insistence on using the contingent house-school link to make his positional externalities argument. <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/04/27/robert-franks-inadvertently-makes-the-case-for-school-choice/">Tim Lee</a> catches the latest instance in Frank's recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/25/AR2008042502783.html">WaPo piece</a>. Tim nails it:
<blockquote>This is an eloquent indictment of our perverse system of linking schools to real estate. We don’t generally limit access to hospitals, libraries, or colleges by geography, and there’s no good reason children’s schools should be determined that way either.

[...]

The most important thing to note, though, is that the scarcity of good schools Frank identifies is <em>not</em> an inherent fact about the universe, but a consequence of the public school monopoly. In a competitive education market, a shortage of good schools in a given area would spur people to either start new schools or expand the best of the existing ones. But the public school system has few mechanisms for doing either of those things (charter schools are a very limited mechanism for starting innovative public schools). Which means that the supply of good public schools is artificially limited, leading parents to bid up their price. The way to alleviate the shortage of good schools is not to re-regulate the mortgage market, but to reform the education system so that it’s easier to start and expand high-quality schools. Few things would do that as effectively as a robust program of school choice.</blockquote>
But that would make sense!
