From <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/03/whats-the-real.html">Tyler Cowen</a>:
<blockquote>When a Pole moves to London he can buy <a href="http://punjabgroceryplus.com/images/483888114_405aff0519%5B1%5D.jpg">many more goods and services</a>.  It's a big move up in real income <em>plus</em> lots of new goods are introduced to the consumption basket.  So when there is lots of voluntary movement from poorer to richer regions, changes in measured income will understate some of the true gains.</blockquote>
The other measurement understated is the reduction in real consumption inequality.
