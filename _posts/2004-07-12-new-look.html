Do you hate it?

You can find the old blog through the <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archive.html">Blogger Archive</a> link over on the right.

You'll be happy to know that the banner image is bits of the blackboard from this famous picture of Wittgenstein.

I'm sure I'll be tinkering with this a fair bit, so your comments and suggestions are welcome.
