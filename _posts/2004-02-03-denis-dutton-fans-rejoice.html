-- Good stuff from the our man at <a href="http://aldaily.com/">Arts and Letters Daily</a>.  A<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A60103-2004Jan29?language=printer"> thoughtful discussion of the role of skeptical doubt</a> occurs in Dutton's review of Jennifer Michael Hecht's <em>The Great Doubters and Their Legacy From Socrates and Jesus to Thomas Jefferson and Emily Dickinson</em>. Besides being eminently sensible, Dutton slips in a few good swipes at Freudians and Marxists. This, also: "These days, except for a few aging professors who still teach postmodern literary theory, few skeptics reject the overall validity of science." Nice.

And then there's this <a href="http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/22/feb04/murray.htm">outstanding, appreciative, but critical, review</a> of Charles Murray's <em>Human Accomplishment</em> in the New Criterion.
