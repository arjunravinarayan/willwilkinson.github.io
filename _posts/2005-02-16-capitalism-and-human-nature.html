The new <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/pr-index.html">Cato Policy Report</a> is out, and the lead article is something I've written on <a href="http://www.cato.org/research/articles/wilkinson-050201.html">what evolutionary psychology can tell us about capitalism</a>. Check it out.

[If you're a print & read sort of person, <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v27n1/cpr-27n1-1.pdf">here's the .pdf</a> of the official printed version.]
