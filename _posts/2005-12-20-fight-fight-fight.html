I agree with <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/12/20/93036/557">Yglesias</a> that Julian and Ross, <a href="http://andrewsullivan.com">guest-blogging for Sullivan</a>, need to fight more for our amusement. Otherwise, I will fight with Ross (well, yell at him, anyway) for my own amusement. You don't want that.
