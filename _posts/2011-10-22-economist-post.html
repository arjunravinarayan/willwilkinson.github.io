French presidential campaigns are rather more interesting than they are here in the U.S. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSL0366942020070504">Reuters reports</a>:
<blockquote>Socialist opponent Segolene Royal said on Friday that France risks violence and brutality if her opponent right-winger Nicolas Sarkozy wins Sunday's presidential election.</blockquote>
Well, no matter who wins -- banlieues ablaze in Peugeot pyres or not -- France risks relative economic backwardness. Now, not everyone thinks this. Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington D.C., <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/04/27/812/">argued last week</a> that the widespread notion that France's straits are especially dire is based on "economic misinformation." But, <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2007/04/29/everythings-swimmy-in-gay-paree/">as I pointed out</a> on my own blog, then it appears that both Edmund Phelps, who won the 2006 economics Nobel Prize, and Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen, who just wrote<em> </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/European-Economy-since-1945-Coordinated/dp/0691127107/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9562014-0899347?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1178295834&amp;sr=8-1">the book</a> on recent European economic history, must be badly misinformed.

Royal may be right that a Sarkozy win will foment fury. But, if so, then that's just proof of the problem, isn't it? A nation in good shape doesn't take the streets to protest the remote chance that the not-technically-socialist candidate will challenge <em>dirigisme </em>in earnest. It seems to me that Royal's prediction (threat?) is predicated on the assumption that there is a deep reserve of discontent in France, and she is probably right. But, then, what's the source?

As I note in <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODg2NTY1YTRlZjZkYmE2MGYyNWM2Zjk5NzJhZWRlMDc=">an article</a> today at <em>National Review Online</em>, the evidence supports the idea that French economic policy is actually depressing French happiness.
<blockquote>In his new paper “<a href="http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000209864.PDF">The Happy Variety of Capitalism</a>,” Stefan Bergheim of Deutsche Bank Research (Deutsche Bank’s internal think tank) discerns a definite pattern in the relationship between average happiness and economic policy in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, leading him to distinguish between the happy, less happy, and unhappy varieties of capitalism. (Everybody, it seems, is some kind of capitalist these days.) While go-go capitalist countries like the United States, Australia, and the UK, and economically dynamic Scandinavian free-traders like Denmark and Sweden rank highest on happiness surveys, the economically sclerotic nations of “Old Europe” — such as Belgium, Austria, Germany, and France — are relegated to second-tier, “less happy” status. Worse still, France lurks at the bottom of the “less happy” nations, doing barely better than the relatively “unhappy” Italians.

Why so glum? The numbers show that high average incomes, a low unemployment rate, extensive economic freedom, and relatively open labor markets tend to boost happiness levels, while generous welfare handouts, lower levels of inequality, and bigger government have little or no positive effect. The areas where the French do relatively well, such as low inequality and size of government, tend not to make its people feel much better, while the areas where they do poorly, such as unemployment and economic freedom, take a real bite out of happiness.</blockquote>
As in last year's labor reform protests, the pent-up frustration and fear Royal thinks may send thousands streaming into the streets may be an effect of the very economic policies the protesters seek to preserve.
