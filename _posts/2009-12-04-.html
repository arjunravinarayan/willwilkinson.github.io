I agree with Thoreau of Unqualified Offerings:
<blockquote>Eight years ago, there was indeed something worth doing in Afghanistan, something that could be justified.  However, eight years is a long time, and now there is nothing worth doing, nothing to justify continued fighting and meddling and killing.  The mistake I made eight years ago was thinking that if there is something that can be justified then it will be done and afterwards we will leave.  I was wrong on both accounts.  It was not done, and we did not leave.</blockquote>
He goes on to say, "I’m never supporting another war.  Ever.  No matter what is done to us." I certainly wouldn't go that far. Thoreau defends himself in the comments like so:
<blockquote>Even if, by some chance, a war comes along that really should be supported, we still need somebody pushing back against it. I’d rather err on the side of pushing back against some hypothetical necessary war than err on the side of supporting an actual clusterfuck.</blockquote>
I feel you, man.
