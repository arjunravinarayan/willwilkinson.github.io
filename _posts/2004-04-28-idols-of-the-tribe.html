-- In light of <a href="http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=00044900-A374-1084-983483414B7F0000">this</a>, I feel I must make some announcements.

I am not a very good driver.

I am no better than average at getting along with others.

I am about as moral as most people. (Better about some things, worse about others.)

I am not going to heaven.

If I believed in God, it would be because I found it a source of consolation.

My explanations of my behavior are inconsistent with my explanations of other people's behavior.

But I admit it. So I'm more rational than you! (And probably better looking.)
