I mentioned the Mercatus Center Global Prosperity Initiative Journalism Fellows <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2004/06/gpi-journalism-fellows.html">a while back</a>. GPI has now posted dispatches from the field from the intrepid fellows. <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/globalprosperity/article.php/783.html">Matt Welch in Romania</a>. <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/globalprosperity/article.php/781.html">Melinda Ammann in Botswana</a>. <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/globalprosperity/article.php/784.html">Mark Hemingway in Philippines</a>. These aren't formal articles. They're dispatches. So they're breezy and chatty, which to my mind makes them even better reading.
