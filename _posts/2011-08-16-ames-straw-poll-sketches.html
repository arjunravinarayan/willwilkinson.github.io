<p>I went to the Ames Straw poll on Saturday, completely ignored the speeches and spent the whole time interviewing Iowans about which candidates they were supporting and why. On Sunday I made these five pen, ink, and watercolor sketches, which<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/faces-of-iowa-sketches-from-the-ames-straw-poll/243618/"> the <em>Atlantic </em>made into a slideshow</a> along with excerpts from the interviews. I wish I could have included my Romney, Palin, and McCottter supporters, but there’s just not enough time in a single Sunday. Anyway, I’ve been wanting to get some illustration work, so I was pretty excited that the <em>Atlantic </em>was game. Check out <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/faces-of-iowa-sketches-from-the-ames-straw-poll/243618/">the official slideshow</a> to read what these folks had to say. And <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/118118984667460138733/AmesStrawPollSketchs?feat=flashalbum#slideshow/5641500408530803138">here’s the sketches again at something close to full size</a>.</p>
