I find myself somehow charmed by this <a href="http://www.takimag.com/blogs/article/the_snowboarder_menace/">no-room-for-satirization Austin Bramwell post</a>. It perfectly exemplifies the quaint essence of elite American conservatism: a sense of grievance at the loss of exclusive WASP folkways. 

For the well-heeled, perhaps the biggest problem with economic growth is that eventually one is forced to compete with the <em>hoi polloi</em> for non-manufacturable goods. In this example, to avoid entirely the snowboarding philistines, one ends up having to <em>own</em> <em>a mountain. </em>But in what kind of damnable world must a Yale man be <em>that </em>rich in order to carve virgin powder?

I feel Bramwell's circle and its habits should be the subject of a careful ethnography, or declared endangered and legally protected, before all is lost. Perhaps he could be placed in a handsome diorama on weekends, so that snowboarding American slobs can contemplate first-hand just how much gracious living their vulgar appetites have displaced.
