From his pretty fascinating <a href="http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/P/gc2224/speeches/gc_1888.htm">1888 State of the Union address</a>:
<blockquote>Communism is a hateful thing and a menace to peace and organized government; but theÂ communism of combined wealth and capital, the outgrowth of overweening cupidity and selfishness, which insidiously undermines the justice and integrity of free institutions, is not less dangerous than the communism of oppressed poverty and toil, which, exasperated by injustice and discontent, attacks with wild disorder the citadel of rule.</blockquote>
