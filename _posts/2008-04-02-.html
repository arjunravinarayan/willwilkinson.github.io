In Clive Crook's stimulating post about a viewing of the television version of Moises Naim's <em>Illicit</em>, there is this important observation.
<blockquote>The scale of illicit trade--which encompasses, to name a few, counterfeiting, money-laundering, illegal drugs, fake medicines, loose nukes, and illegal immigrants--is huge. The pattern of trade is complex, organized and extended. Traders large and small have been much faster and more adept at developing their networks than governments have been in interrupting them: <strong>borders empower the criminals, and disempower the authorities</strong>.</blockquote>
Reminds me of the Duke boys racing the Roscoe P. Coltrane to the county line.
