<b>Come to the Biotech Debate!!!</b> -- The great conservative vs. libertarian biotech debate is impending. And you need to be there if you want to enjoy the Sanchez/Wilkinson intellectual pyrotechnics live and in person! (And, you know, Ramesh Ponnuru and Justin Torres doing their... thing.) Got a hot date? Bring 'em! Argue after about whether you'd give your future kids a genetic IQ boost! ("Honey, it's not "disgusting" it's just sorta like a prenatal Kaplan course.") Going to a concert instead? Don't be stupid! Julian looks like a rock star! (And if you try to give him red M&Ms, he'll throw a TV into a swimming pool.) In the unlikely event that we start losing, I'll do a striptease to distract the crowd. Lucky for you, I just trimmed my chest hair (though it remains plentiful and lush.) And moderator <a href="http://law.cua.edu/fac_staff/smithl/">Judge Loren Smith</a> is fairly dripping with Orson Welles sex appeal. So what's your excuse? Come!
