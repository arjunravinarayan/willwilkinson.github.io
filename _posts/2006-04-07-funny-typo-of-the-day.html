<p>From Bart Schulz's outstanding <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sidgwick/">SEP entry on Henry Sidgwick</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Sidgwick's versatile and many-sided intellect—not to mention his keen wit—are typically better displayed in his essays and letters than in his best-known academic books. He was in fact much loved for his gentle humor (or “Sidgwickedness”) and sympathetic conversation, and his philosophical students prized him for his condor.</p>
