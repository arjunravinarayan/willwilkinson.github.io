<b>The Benevolent Market </b>-- Also in <i>Reason</i>, check out <a href="http://www.reason.com/rb/rb022702.shtml">Ron Bailey's piece</a> on some cross cultural experiments conducted by anthropologists and economists. It turns out that people experienced with markets are nicer. The experiments are part of a fascinating <a href="http://www.umass.edu/preferen/">larger project</a> to develop a realistic alternative to the startlingly silly <i>homo economicus</i> model of human behavior.

Herbert Gintis, who is featured in Bailey's piece, has always struck me as a very cool, intellectually open guy. He occasionally makes great contributions to <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/evolutionary-psychology">the big evolutionary psychology email listserv</a>.

And outstanding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691009430/qid=1014786855/sr=12-1/002-8713567-7152800">books</a> on game theory. I declare Gintis my favorite leftist! (Everybody should have one.)
