-- Interesting short piece on <a href="http://www.philosophersmag.com/article.php?id=735">rational irrationality</a> by Alfred Mele. I had the good fortune of meeting and chatting with Prof. Mele at <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/socialchange/article.php/367.html">a small conference</a> I helped organize for Mercatus on self-deception hosted by Tyler Cowen and Robin Hanson. It was a really fascinating couple of days. In particular, I enjoyed meeting <a href="http://anthro.rutgers.edu/faculty/trivers.shtml">Bob Trivers</a>, who is one of the weirdest, most fascinating people I've ever met. He said he liked my phenotype. I think because I gave him a George Mason ball cap. Thomas Schelling was also there. I just ran across Schelling's <em>lovely</em> <a href="http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/schelling83.pdf">Tanner Lecture on self-control</a>. There are few people who write as lucidly and engagingly as Schelling while maintaining as high a level of theoretical interest. You should read it.
