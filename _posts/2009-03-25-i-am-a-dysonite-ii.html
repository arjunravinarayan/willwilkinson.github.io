<blockquote>Dyson has great affection for coal and for one big reason: It is so inexpensive that most of the world can afford it. “There’s a lot of truth to the statement Greens are people who never had to worry about their grocery bills,” he says. (“Many of these people are my friends,” he will also tell you.) To Dyson, “the move of the populations of China and India from poverty to middle-class prosperity should be the great historic achievement of the century. Without coal it cannot happen.” That said, Dyson sees coal as the interim kindling of progress. In “roughly 50 years,” he predicts, <a title="More articles about solar power." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/solar_energy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">solar energy</a> will become cheap and abundant, and “there are many good reasons for preferring it to coal.”</blockquote>
I predict the transition to cheap solar will happen faster than that, but I would defer to Dyson.
