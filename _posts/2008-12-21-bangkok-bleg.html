Sorry for the nonexistent blogging. Kerry and I are heading to Bangkok for Christmas, and then to Burma. Blogging will likely remain nonexistent, except perhaps for a picture or two. So what should we do in Bangkok? One well-traveled friend suggested "street food and, don't take this the wrong way, the prostitutes." So that's covered. What else? Restaurants? Specific not-to-be-missed, off-the-beaten-path sites? Â </div>
