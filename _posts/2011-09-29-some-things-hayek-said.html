For future reference:
<blockquote>There is no reason why in a free society government should not assure to all protection against severe deprivation in the form of an assured minimum income, or a floor below which nobody need to descend. To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organized community, those who cannot help themselves. So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the Rule of Law.

What we now know as public assistance or relief, which in various forms is provided in all countries, is merely the old poor law adapted to modern conditions. The necessity of some such arrangement in an industrial society is unquestioned—be it only in the interest of those who require protection against acts of desperation on the part of the needy. (405)</blockquote>
About that last bit, FH isn't saying self-protection against the desperation of the needy is the best argument for a safety net, only that even the most niggardly bastards feel the force of this argument, which is why the necessity some arrangement of public necessity if unquestioned.

&nbsp;

If a wealthy country fails to offer public assistance to those in need, we can only expect that some people will become so desperate that they will have little choice but to steal what they need to live, and to use the violence necessary to do it and get away with it. If you lack compassion for those in need, you should at least see the need to protect yourself from the violent exigencies such society-wide stinginess would create.

Here's Hayek arguing for the "individual mandate":
<blockquote>Once it becomes the recognized duty of the public to provide for the extreme needs of old age, unemployment, sickness, etc., irrespective of whether the individuals could and ought to have made provision themselves, and particularly once help is assured to such an extent that it is apt to reduce individuals’ efforts, it seems an obvious corollary to compel them to insure (or otherwise provide) against those common hazards of life. The justification in this case is not that people should be coerced to do what is in their individual interest but that, by neglecting to make provision, they would become a charge to the public. Similarly, we require motorists to insure against thirdparty risks, not in their interest but in the interest of others who might be harmed by their action.</blockquote>
