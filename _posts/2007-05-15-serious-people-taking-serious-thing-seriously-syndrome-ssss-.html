Can anything save our blighted world from collapse under the crushing weight of its superficiality? Can anything fill our dessicated, hollowed-out souls with something more than the vapid detritus of consumer capitalism?  Can anyone inspire in the hearts of men a new reverence for the permanent things? Yes! Serious People Taking Serious Things Seriously!

Victims of SSSS are terrified of others discovering that they are not in fact serious. This is the source of the alternately sighingly bemused and hyperventilating approach to atheists.
