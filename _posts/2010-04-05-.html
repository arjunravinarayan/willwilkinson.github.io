This kind of thing, below, from InsideHigherEd, is why I stressed the importance of not seeing that OKTrends charts as depicting changes in our political opinions as we age, but as depicting a snapshot of Â the political opinions of different generational.
<blockquote>In all, [Gross and Cheng in a survey of academics] found that 71 percent of the interviewees (and 81 percent of liberals) formed their political views early in life -- in childhood, adolescence or early adulthood (by 25). Only in engineering and economics -- notably disciplines that tend not to have as large a liberal share as others -- were less than half of respondents not reporting an "early political socialization."</blockquote>
