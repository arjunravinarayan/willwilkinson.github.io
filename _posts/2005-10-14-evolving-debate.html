I haven't been able to follow the debate over Buller's <em>Adapting Minds</em> as closely as I would like. (I never finished the post I was writing about Fodor's silly review.)&nbsp; But the debate proceeds apace. Cosmides and Tooby have put up a page with <a target="_self" href="http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/buller.htm">preliminary replies</a> to Buller. University of Wisconsin anthropologist John Hawks has blogged a nice <a target="_self" href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/behavior/buller/adapting_minds_chapter_3.html?seemore=y">overview of some of Buller's main arguments</a>, and a <a target="_self" href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/behavior/buller/buller_critiques_2005.html">response to C&amp;T's claim</a> that Buller has ignored evidence about social exhange. Buller's <a target="_self" href="http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/ticsreply.pdf">reply to critics</a> [pdf] in <em>Trends of Cognitive Science</em> is on his website. Hawks <a target="_self" href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog/reviews/behavior/buller/buller_website_2005.html">compares the debate</a> to the already fabled case of <em>Python v Crocodile. </em>
