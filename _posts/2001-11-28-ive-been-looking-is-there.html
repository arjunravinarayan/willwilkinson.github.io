<b>I've been looking</b>.... Is there an argument against cloning other than (1) We shouldn't be playing God, (2) It makes me feel really funny, or (3) It's not safe yet?

(1) and (2) are ridiculous, because there is no God (and if there were she'd want us to do it) and feeling funny isn't an objection to anything. (3) is a perfectly good argument, but without staying power; it'll be safe soon enough.

I'm interested in having a good debate about this, but there seems to be too little intellectual substance on the "neg" side to have one.

Okay, let me put out some argument bait. I'll even put it in terms prejudiced against my side (no parents desperate for children/organ transplant or die stuff). So... Suppose I want a clone of myself, just for kicks (I'd be a good dad and all), and I find a willing egg-womb donor. Why shouldn't I be able to do it?

Fire away.
