Julian <a href="http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2005/05/the_literary_la_1.php">sends me this meme</a>:  "What 5 books are you vaguely embarassed to admit you haven't read?" Here goes:

(1) Max Weber, <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism</em>. I keep suspecting that my intuitions about markets and culture are closer to a Weberian sociologist than to those of an  economist, which makes me feel like I should really read this book and find out.

(2)Derek Parfit, <em>Reasons and Persons</em>. Some of the smartest people I know, such as Tyler and Julian, think this is a great work of philosophy. My former grad advisor Chris Morris gave me this helpful category: "Books I've read, but not by myself." I've read so much secondary literature about <em>Reasons and Persons</em> that it seems like I've read it. I consider it among the books I've read, but just not by myself. But I suppose I should actually work my way through it.

(3)Carson McCullers, <em>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter</em>. This is my beloved housemate's favorite book (and number 17 on the Random House 100 best novels list) and I keep meaning to read it, but am ashamed to say, I cannot generate the motivation to do it.

(4) Thomas Hobbes, <em>Leviathan</em>. I sincerely believe that this is the most important work of political philosophy in the English language. So I should probably get around to reading the whole thing one of these days. I'm pretty sure I've read the good parts, but who knows!?

(5) Robert Nozick, <em>Anarchy, State, and Utopia</em>. This is truly shameful, but I've never actually gotten to Utopia. Again, I know what it says, but not because I've <em>read</em> what it says.

I pass the meme to <a href="http://feyaccompli.com/">Joanna Robinson</a>, <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/">Tyler Cowen</a>, and <a href="http://alina_stefanescu.typepad.com/totalitarianism_today/">Alina Stefanescu</a>.
