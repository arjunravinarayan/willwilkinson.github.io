From <strong>reason</strong> comments, I found <a href="http://www.reason.com/blog/show/124418.html#883406">this</a> pretty funny:
<blockquote><a href="http://i7.tinypic.com/86zattz.jpg" rel="nofollow">Cosmotarianism</a>: Parking Vespas in the handicap spot at Trader Joe's since 1996. Take <em>that</em>, police state!

<img src="http://i7.tinypic.com/86zattz.jpg" height="444" width="472" /></blockquote>
That said, this picture is sexist; I deplore it. And I bet Ludwig von Mises had a Vespa!
<blockquote>[Liberal] thinking is cosmopolitan and ecumenical: it takes in all men and the whole world. Liberalism is, in this sense, humanism; and the liberal, a citizen of the world, a cosmopolite.</blockquote>
Classical liberalism, as Mises and I understand it,  <em>just is </em>a cosmopolitan doctrine.
