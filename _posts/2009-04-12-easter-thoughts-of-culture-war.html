I was recently reading somewhere about Christopher Hitchens' debate with William Lane Craig at Biola and someone in the comments of whatever blog I was reading made the observation that there are tons of Christian schools like Biola and Wheaton and so forth full of smart kids who undergo training in arguing for the existence of God. It's not like it's treated as an open question at these places. The Christian schools and their Christian students know the result they need, and they practice in the most persuasive arguments that deliver that result. None of these arguments are any good, of course, as there is no God, Jesus didn't rise from the dead, and so on. But my sense is that there are about a gazillion works of theistic/Christian apologetics for every <em>God Is Not Great. </em>But write a <em>God Is Not Great</em> or a <em>The End of Faith </em>and<em> </em>you're colored as some kind of obnoxious disrespectful lout out to set the lions on all those downtrodden Christian. Why is that? Even other atheists are encouraged to deplore the brazen "New Atheists'" alleged in-your-face lack of humility. I find this completely ridiculous. They're right, after all. I also think it's ridiculous that Christopher Hitchens represents the atheist side in approximately 75 percent of all debates about the existence of God. (Why should he hoard all the speaking fees!?) Why aren't more philosophy professors--few of whom believe in God--standing up to fight for truth? Well, lots of them don't like the dog and pony show of public debates, I'm sure. Lots of them don't want to be impolite. But I'd also guess that they find the arguments so boring that it's a drag to prepare. Nevertheless, this stuff matters and it's important to wean the culture off superstition. Hitchens is more than pulling his weight, but I'm afraid most intellectuals who also happen to be atheists aren't taking this culture war stuff seriously enough. So get in there faithless people! Mix it up! It's true that pretty much only other Christians care about Alvin Plantinga or William Lane Craig, but there are hoards of bright young Christians who really do think this stuff is more than polish on their parochial cultural inheritance, and that's really too bad.
