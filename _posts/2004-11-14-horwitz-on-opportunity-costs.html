I'm pleased to see that <a href="http://it.stlawu.edu/shor/">Steven Horwitz</a>, a real live top-notch economist and master of <a href="http://www.mises.org/humanaction/chap14sec1.asp">catallactics</a>, has endorsed my interpretation of the opportunity cost puzzle <a href="http://catallarchy.net/blog/archives/2004/11/10/opportunity-cost-puzzle/#comment-9244">in the comments</a> over at Catallarchy. Steve, who taught at an IHS seminar I ran two summers ago naturally attributes my rightness to his pedagogical prowess. I don't dispute it.
