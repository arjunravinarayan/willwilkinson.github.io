-- What are you looking at? Janet's feigned expression of horror? Her bizarre nipple accoutrements? Not me! The most interesting thing about this picture is . . .  J. Tim's "beard"! Timberlake is but one data point in my embodied argument that the beard is now the height of fashion. Start yours now or be like the guy who finally decided the goatee is "cool" some time in 2002 and ended up looking like some jackass relief pitcher for the Astros.
