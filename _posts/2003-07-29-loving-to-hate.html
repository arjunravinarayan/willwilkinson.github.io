-- I can only heartily second Anne Applebaum's sentiment in her  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40170-2003Jul24.html">biting review</a> of Coulter's <em>Treason</em>.

<em>Even the company of Maoist insurgents would be more intellectually invigorating than that of Ann Coulter. More to the point, whatever side this woman is on, I don't want to be on it.</em>
