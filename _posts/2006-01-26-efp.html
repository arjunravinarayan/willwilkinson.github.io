It is becoming increasingly clear to me that a great deal of confusion in economics, psychology, and especially happiness studies results from a rather naive mistake. Everything is illuminated once the mistake is acknowledged.

Distinguish between three distinct intellectual formations.

(1) Neo-classical formal utility theory
(2) Economist folk psychology
(3) Real psychological theory

The giant mistake is economist folk psychology (EFP). EFP is generally a ridiculous ad hoc clusterf*ck of utility theory, folk psychology, and real psychological theory. EFP is so often ridiculous because it arbitrarily assumes that (a) utility theory is normative, and (b) translates concepts in utility theory---a formal theory and not a substantive theory of human behavior---into a folk psychological idiom. "Utility" in utility theory is translated willy nilly as "pleasure" or "happiness." "Preference" in utility theory is translated as "desire" or "want"

The reason economists resort to EFP is that they want to have <em>something</em> to say about actual human behavior, despite the fact that utility theory, which they have mastered, models ideal agents that only faintly resemble human beings, and has no predictive content whatsoever (i.e., it makes no generalizations about the structure of preferences, e.g., that a good backrub is generally preferred over a trouserful of tacks. )

Of course, the quality of EFP varies from economist to economist, depending on the savviness of their background, non-economic psychological assumptions, and their implicit rules for translating utility theory into a psychological idiom. Amartya Sen and James Buchanan's wise versions of EFP are, well, different in a lot of ways from Stephen Landsburgh's, for example. (I would even argue that Sen and Buchanan, like Schelling, got the Nobel <em>because</em> of the sophisticated philosophical and psychological content of their versions of EFP, not simply for their formal work.) It's a scandal that utility theory is hauled out to show the rigorous "science" of the economics profession, when in fact all the work is done by the dark art of high-quality EFP, the principles of which are rarely articulated and generally left implicit in the reasoning of the best economists. My favorite economists are precisely the one's who have mastered, but don't much trust, the refined art of transposing utility theory into a human key, and understand that what they're really doing is behavioral psychology (theoretical and applied), and that they might as well just admit it, and try to do it right. I think of Hayek, Doug North, Vernon Smith. (And I find that when economists mistake me for an economist, it is not because I can do math, because I can't, but because I've absorbed up a pretty fancy version of EFP through extended exposure to some of the living masters.)

Anyway, that said, EFP causes a lot of trouble. If economists were able to say: "Well there's utility theory on the one hand, and real psychological theory on the other," then everything would be fine. But economists appear to be constitutionally unable to do this. Instead, they insist on being scandalized by the fact that, say, real world "preferences" are often intransitive, or shift wildly with context, or are subject to framing effects, etc.

Bruno Frey and Alois Stutzer in their excellent book Happiness and Economics demonstrate the hazards of EFP in their chapter on "Income."

Most economists take it as a matter of course that higher income leads to higher happiness. And why not? A higher income expands individuals' and countries' opportunity set; that is, more goods and services can be consumed. The few people not interested in more commodities need not consume them; they have the freedom to dispose of any unwanted surplus free of charge. It therefore seems obvious that income and happiness go together . . . Consequently, economics textbooks do not even make an effort to come up with a reason, but simply state that utility U is raised by income Y: U = U(y), with U' > 0.

I think they have it backwards. Economics textbooks define utility as a function of income.
