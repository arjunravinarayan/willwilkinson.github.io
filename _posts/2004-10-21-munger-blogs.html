I just discovered that my pal, Duke Poli Sci chair, and Social Change Workshop faculty member Mike Munger <a href="http://mungowitzend.blogspot.com/">has a blog</a>. He appears to be doing a fantastic job as the voice of reason in Duke's <a href="http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/newscontent.php3?artid=10029">l'affaire de Kurian</a>, which David Bernstein is heated up about <a href="http://premium.theonion.com/news/index.php?id=929">over at the VC</a>.

Check it out(I'm pretty sure that's a photo of Buchanan & Tullock in his header). Mike is wickedly smart, thinks he's real funny, and is a mensch of a good-ol-boy.
