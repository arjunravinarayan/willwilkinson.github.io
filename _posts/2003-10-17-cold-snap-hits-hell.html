-- Maybe it was a slow day. Nevertheless, I was stunned and delighted by the efficiency of the District of Columbia Department of Motor Vehicles. I stopped in to get a DC driver's license, and, get this, my number was called BEFORE I COULD FINISH FILLING OUT THE FORM! Then the photo guy called my name AS SOON AS I SAT DOWN. I think I waited a total of 45 seconds, surely a record.

Then, I went to get my emissions inspection. Again, I DID NOT WAIT (although Half St. SW is sort of hard to find.) It was done in maybe five minutes. I got my clean bill of automotive health, the sticker on my window, a pat on the ass, and I was on my way.

Here's to you Washington, D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles!
