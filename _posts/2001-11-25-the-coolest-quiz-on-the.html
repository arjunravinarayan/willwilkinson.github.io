The coolest quiz on the web for determining your political orientation is <a href="http://www.politopia.com">Politopia.com</a>. Politopia is an island where your political opinions determine where you live, and it's not bound down by the tired one dimensional left/right model (represented in Politopia by the Old Main Stream). Look at the funny cartoons, take the quiz, tell a friend! Put in will@willwilkinson.net and find out where I live.  And complain to the webmaster that Jesse Ventura is <i>not</i> a libertarian. (Full disclosure: Politopia is a production of <a href="http://www.theihs.org">The Institute for Humane Studies</a>, my employer.)
