From <a href="http://www.mensactivism.org/article.pl?sid=01/11/23/198240&mode=flat">mensactivism.org</a>:

<i>The YWCA of Middle Tennessee recently ran an ad in both the Nashville Scene and Nashville's City Paper depicting the blurred image of a young boy walking up to his front door. The caption: "One day he'll own his own house...raise his own kids...beat his own wife." </i>

It's part of an anti-domestic abuse campaign. Apparently the small print at the bottom of the ad explains "the cycle of abuse" and the ad is supposed to be about that. Sucks to be a boy these days. Saw an elementary school girl with this shirt on a while back: "Girls Rule, Boys Drool!" Yeah... that and they're destined to beat the living shit out of you.
