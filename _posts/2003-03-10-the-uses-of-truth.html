-- Lovely little <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/articleprint.php?num=13">essay</a> by Dennett against the postmodernists. (Link from A&L Daily).

Let me quote just one line, in appreciation of the metaphor. Dennett is speaking of the way disputes on the frontiers of science provide for some the impression that science isn't reliable, or is just one style of assertion among other.

"[T]he warfare on the cutting edge of any science draws attention away from the huge uncontested background, the dull metal heft of the axe that gives the cutting edge its power."
