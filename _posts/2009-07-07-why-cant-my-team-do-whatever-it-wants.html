<a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/07/do_democrats_realize_theyre_in.html">Ezra Klein is annoyed</a> with the Obama adminstration's pusillanimous pussyfooting. Even that foul-mouthed hard-guy Rahm Emanuel is a squish these days. Why are the Democratic powers-that-be willing even to entertain the lame "trigger" public plan, which kicks in only if private plans fail to hit certain benchmarks for performance. Klein:
<blockquote>What Emanuel is saying here, however, is that in 2009, when Democrats control the White House, the House of Representatives, and the U.S. Senate -- and have larger margins than Republicans ever did in the latter two -- that they are interested in settling on the same policy compromise [behind Medicare Part D, a product of a Republican president and Congress]: a weak public plan that would be activated if certain conditions aren't met by private industry. That's a bit weird. Weren't elections supposed to have consequences?</blockquote>
Policy follows public opinion, more or less. And the public hasn't really changed much since 2003. This is something partisans have to learn and relearn again and again. If a policy was unpopular before a change in the party controlling government, it will probably remain unpopular after. And politicians like getting reelected. It's pretty simply, really.

Bush couldn't reform Social Security because his plan was unpopular. Obama won't be able to deliver a health-care bill ideological Democrats want, because what they want is unpopular and legislators know it. So Congressional Democrats want something they can cast as "victory" while doing nothing that could hurt their noble struggle for ongoing political self-preservation. Right now, strongly ideological media liberals like Klein have to decide whether they're going to (a) act as enforcers, sending the signal to the powers-that-be that they will vocally and publicly count a "trigger" plan as a pathetic failure, or (b) sigh and prepare to declare whatever legislation passes a profound victory for ordinary Americans that shows just how great Democrats are.

But I imagine this one's a tough call. For lots of ideological Democrats, the <em>point</em> of preserving political capital is to secure real universal health care. So I expect to see a fair amount of (potentially counterproductive) enforcer rhetoric.
