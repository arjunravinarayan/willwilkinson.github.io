I've mentioned St. Louis U. philosopher Dan Haybron a couple times before. His is the best stuff on happiness in the philosophical literature. And I'm almost a little bit disappointed that I agree with his position as thoroughly as I do. Haybron rejects both the hedonic and life satisfaction conceptions of happiness in favor of a what he calls the emotional state view, by which he means that happiness is a kind of steady, pervasive set of dispositions to feel positively. The opposite of happiness is depression, chronic anxiety, or melancholy. On this sort of view, a person who has undergone surgery and is in terrific pain for a long period of time might still be happy. In this kind of case, the steady disposition to feel good simply isn't realized, but it's still there. And there is no reason to believe that people's judgments about their lives will closely track this kind of pervasive emotional condition. A happy person who has suffered a serious setback in life may say that things aren't going well, but that may leave her deep, underlying affective dispositions unaffected.
This me riffing now, not Haybron. I think part of what happiness in this sense involves is asymmetry in speed of adaptation. Seligman in <em>Authentic Happiness</em> remarks that the emotions aren't at all like Freud had it. They don't build pressure, and failing to "let it out" won't cause you to blow a gasket ("bottle up and explode!") or transmogrify the emotion through a kind of emotional alchemy into some other perverted form. Emotions are more like balloons with a semi-porous membrane. They fill with the air of the emotion---the emotional bladder fills with rage or grief---but, absent new infusions, the emotion just seeps away and the balloon deflates. Expressing the emotion dramatically, or rehearsing it over and over in thought or conversation can just keep the feeling inflated and alive. This is why grief therapy can be bad for you. And why a tendency to nurse grievances is detrimental to happiness.
A dispositionally happy person might be thought of as somebody whose negative emotions deflate quickly and whose positive emotions deflate slowly. There can also be complex relations between positive and negative emotions. There are people whose positive emotions deflate whenever a negative emotion is inflated, or vice versa. And there are people who sustain positive emotions, even when certain negative emotions loom large. The happiest type might be the those for whom strong positive emotions tend to deflate negative ones, but for whom stong negative emotions cannot fully deflate positive ones.

Now, happy people in this sense ought to rate high on hedonism and life satisfaction scales. People disposed to feel good longer and more often, and feel bad shorter and less, or to feel good in some way even when feeling bad in others, will on average feel better. And people who on average feel better will likely say they do. But the symptoms of the condition shouldn't be confused for condition itself.
Now, I don't think it's all about pattens of emotional inflation and deflation. There's also a matter of "default tone"---how you feel when there's nothing special going on, when the surface of your emotional seas are glassy.

I think it's pretty interesting that all sorts of combinations of emotional inflation-deflation patterns and default tone are hedonically equivalent. But all of them aren't happiness. I think happiness has something to do with a relatively smooth hedonic flow. A fairly negative default tone with frequent huge, euphoric positive upswings and slow deflation back to default may register more total hedons than a mildly positive default tone with mild upswings and mild downswings. But the first well might be a case of bipolar disorder and require serious professional medical attention. And that's just not happiness, no matter how huge the hedonic payoff of the upswing. My sense is that a lot of Westeners resist the ideals of Buddhism because we think it takes hedonic smoothing too far. Buddhism asks you to trade hedonic volatility for a better default tone. Actually, this framework explains a couple different things you might get out of a serious practice of Eastern mindfulness, and why it has bigger returns for some than others. If you have a good default tone, but suffer from frequent or large negative spikes---you're quick to anger, easily frustrated, often indignant, etc.---a practice that simply leaves you at the default tone more of the time will be big improvement. However, if you've got good default tone,
