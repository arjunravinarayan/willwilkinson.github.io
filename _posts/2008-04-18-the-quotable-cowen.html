<blockquote>The general point remains that most discussions of global warming focus on prices and technologies alone, without incorporating realistic models of politics.</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/04/climate-solutio.html">More here</a>. The failure to incorporate realistic models of politics into one's thinking is the reason many people are statist in the first place. When they are <a href="http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?articleID=536&amp;issueID=42"><em>romantically</em> statist</a>, you know there is little hope in having a productive conversation.Â  When concerted political action based on this or that moral framework is conceived as a redemptive ideal, questioning its desirability just makes you a bad person. Tyler is right that "Being pro-science also means being pro-economic science." But for many pushing large, immediate anti-warming action, there is exceedingly little interest in science per se, but a great deal of interest in the rhetorical and political possibilities of science. When you see <a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-economist-has-no-clothes">Scientific American giving its pages over to English teachers</a> to argue that economics is not a science, in order to clear the way for political action, you can be sure that the science of it all is not really the paramount concern.
