The writing along the bottom edge of the badge are lyrics from the Beatles classic "Don't Let Me Down": "I'm in love for the first time. Don't you know it's gonna last. It's a love that last forever. It's a love that has no past." Completely disgusting. <a href="http://omgposters.com/2008/11/12/im-in-love-for-the-first-time-dont-let-me-down-obama-art-print-by-jon-smith/">Only $200! </a>
