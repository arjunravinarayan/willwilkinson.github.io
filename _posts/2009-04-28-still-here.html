No, I haven't been conscripted into the Mounties, though I appreciate the concern. Between the trip to Canada (which included an extra night due to the caprice of airlines), a couple of deadlines, and multi-day wedding program activities in Charleston, I haven't had much extra time to blog. But I'll get right back at it as soon as I finish a bit more "real" writing.
