<blockquote>I find every ambitious town sends you a message.  New York tells you "you should make more money."  LA tells you "you should be better looking." Rome tells you "you should dress better."  London tells you "you should be hipper."  The Bay Area tells you "you should live better."  And Cambridge tells you "you should read some  of those books you've been meaning to."</blockquote>
What does Washington, DC tell you?

The first thing that came to my mind is: "you should get more powerful friends." What are you hearing?
