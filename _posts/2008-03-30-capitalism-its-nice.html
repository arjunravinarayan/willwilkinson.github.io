These findings have been rolling in over the last half-decade or so: democratic market cultures produce a tendency to cooperation.Â  <a href="http://bps-research-digest.blogspot.com/2008/03/how-group-cooperation-varies-between.html">Here's more</a>:
<blockquote>Researchers use economic games to investigate how people cooperate in real-life. Now a team led by <a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/economics/staff/details/b.herrmann.htm">Benedikt <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_0" class="blsp-spelling-error">Herrmann</span></a>, at the University of Nottingham, have identified striking differences in the way university students from different countries play one such game known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_goods_game">The Public Goods Game</a>. Compared with students from developed Western nations, students from less democratic countries like Saudi Arabia, Oman and Belarus tended to punish not only free-loaders, but also cooperative players, with the result that cooperation in their groups <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_1" class="blsp-spelling-corrected">plummeted</span>.

In a commentary on the findings, published in the same journal, Herbert <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_3" class="blsp-spelling-error">Gintis</span> of the <span id="SPELLING_ERROR_4" class="blsp-spelling-error">Sante</span> Fe Institute, said the results challenge the way people have tended to view capitalist democracies. "The success of democratic market societies may depend critically upon moral virtues as well as material interests, so the depiction of civil society as the sphere of 'naked self-interest' is radically incorrect," he wrote.</blockquote>
All this should not be surprising. People in places that got rich by doing more than finding useful stuff in the ground got that way by getting good at cooperating.
