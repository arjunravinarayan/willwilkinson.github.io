Although I cannot claim to be a big big fan of televised sporting type activities, I must say that baseball, when it is not absolutely ennervating and soul killing, can be pretty exciting. However, we must solemnly pray that George Will is not inspired to write a baseball column, which would utterly negate any excitement generated by the ALCS. Dear Jesus, please strike George Will dead, before he writes about baseball again.

Die Yankees. Die.
