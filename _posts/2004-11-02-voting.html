It is done. The duty of citizenship has been discharged. My polling place was the perfect setting: the middle school gym. Sadly, there was nothing much to vote against in DC. There is nothing quite like the simple satisfaction of voting against bond issues one after the other. I did get to vote for shadow rep, an idea than which there is none more useless. Carol Schwartz, you have my heart. And I've got a very good feeling about Badnarik. An upset is imminent!
