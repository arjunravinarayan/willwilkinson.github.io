I'll say more about<a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWVkNzZjOGQzMDUzMzNhM2YyNDI4MDdlNzU1MjFlNGI="> John Hood's post</a> later. For now, let's look at just this:
<blockquote>Most libertarians would rather live in a society with a smaller welfare state and illegal drugs than they would live in a bigger welfare state with legal drugs.</blockquote>
Is this true? Let's find out!

I've never done this before, but I just used Google Docs to devise a simple poll. I hope it works! If you would not consider yourself a libertarian, please refrain from participating. I'll post the results tomorrow.
