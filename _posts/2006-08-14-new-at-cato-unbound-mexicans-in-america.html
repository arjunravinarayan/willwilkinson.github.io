<p>Don't miss the new Cato Unbound featuring this morning's <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/08/14/richard-rodriguez/mexicans-in-america/">lead essay by Richard Rodriguez</a>. </p> <blockquote> <p>Americans have tended to abrogate to economists the question of the costs and the benefits of illegal immigration. But, surely, beyond how much Betsy Ross is willing to pay for a head of lettuce, there is the question of morality, there is the question of Mexico. How much of Mexico are we willing to take within our borders? I believe the question might better be asked of a theologian, than an economist.</p></blockquote> <p>Rodriguez is no theologian, but he gives it a shot. Watch out for Victor Davis Hanson's reply Wednesday. He's not thrilled with Rodriguez. </p>
