I've decided to start <a href="http://happinesspolicy.com">a single issue blog</a> devoted to happiness research, policy, and politics, in support of the paper I am writing for Cato and as a one-stop resource for others interested in happiness and policy (but perhaps not interested in other stuff I write about here.) All my Fly Bottle happiness posts, along with your comments, have been imported there. I'll start out cross-posting happiness stuff, but eventually (when Google starts to notice the new blog), I'll start just pointing you to <a href="http://happinesspolicy.com">Happiness and Public Policy</a>. I'm just getting started setting the thing up, and there's a lot more to come, including bibliographical resources, featured books, and other useful research tools.
