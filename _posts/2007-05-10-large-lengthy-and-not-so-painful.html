Large, lengthy, and not so painful

I liked Clive Crook's conclusion to <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/a085a206-fe55-11db-bdc7-000b5df10621.html">his column</a> on Alan Blinder's high-profile handwringing over the traumas of offshore outsourcing, despite the fact that he remains as fully pro-trade as ever:
<blockquote>Let me suggest another approach. Keep on patiently explaining why, implausible as it seems to non-economists, liberal trade in goods and services really is good for importers and exporters alike. Explain why, odd as it may seem, offshoring really is no different. Keep arguing for policies that widen the gains and help the victims, to be sure, but never concede those main points, or suppose they do not need defending. No question, it is thankless and repetitive work, but until it can be offshored, we need Alan Blinder to pull his weight.</blockquote>
As <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/05/blinder-on-offshoring.html">Greg Mankiw observes</a>, the time frame over which domestic labor markets will respond is so long that it is really pretty misleading to make it seem like there is going to be some kind of violent dislocation.
<blockquote> <span class="extras">Alan says the transition to the new equilibrium will be "large, lengthy and painful." When he spoke at Harvard last week, he said the transition would take about 30 years. But the very length of the transition will make it less painful. Over the course of a generation, workers can gradually retire from shrinking industries, and new workers can be trained for the growing industries that take their place. Of course, some individuals will experience painful transitions, but that is always the case in a dynamic market economy. I don't expect future transitions to be macroeconomically different than past transitions. Even if imports as a percentage of GDP continue to rise as Alan predicts, I would nonetheless expect the average rate of unemployment for the U.S. economy to be about the same over the next thirty years as it has been over the past thirty.</span></blockquote>
I expect the dislocating effects of offshoring to be much less dramatic than the effect of accelerating technological change. I think if you want to be worried about something, you should <a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/aigrow.pdf">be worried about robots</a>, not Indians with spreadsheets.
