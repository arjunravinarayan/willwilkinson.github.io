Like Paul, he is anti-war, anti-big government and pro-civil liberties. But unlike Paul, he is pro-choice (except for late-term abortions), pro-immigration, pro-trade and untainted by bizarre conspiracy theories that NAFTA is a <a href="http://reason.org/news/printer/going-protectionist-over-a-fan">prelude</a> to the dissolution of North American borders. Nor does he have Paul’s <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/angry-white-man">racist</a> newsletter baggage. His signature issue is not abolishing the Fed or returning to the gold standard. Rather, it is avoiding the impending financial collapse by cutting government spending on everything by 43 percent — Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and defense — a plan bolder than any that either party has proffered.
