I agree <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?pagewanted=3">with Freeman Dyson</a>:
<blockquote>Beyond the specific points of factual dispute, Dyson has said that it all boils down to “a deeper disagreement about values” between those who think “nature knows best” and that “any gross human disruption of the natural environment is evil,” and “humanists,” like himself, who contend that protecting the existing biosphere is not as important as fighting more repugnant evils like war, poverty and unemployment. </blockquote>
Here is <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/03/25/am_wilkinson/">my Marketplace commentary from this morning</a> describing the risky fuiltity of cap and trade. I realize now that it may have been too strong to say that China is "the world's largest owner of dollar-denominated assets," though I'm not totally sure that's wrong. What I meant is that China owns more U.S. debt and holds larger USD cash reserves than other country.
