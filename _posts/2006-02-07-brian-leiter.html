I recently chatted with a colleague of Brian Leiter's from the University of Texas (in law or philosophy, I won't say.) I asked him something along the lines of how well Brian Leiter is tolerated there. His reply was something to the effect that about half the faculty wish he would drop dead, while the other half would like see him drawn and quartered.

This post in which he attacks Arnold Kling I think perfectly illustrates why Leiter has come to be so well-loathed by his colleagues. Here you can see Leiter (a) attempting to be a bullying arbiter of intellectual respectibility with (b) an incredibly truculent and superior attitude while revealing himself to be (c) a viciously dogmatic ideologue with little interest in evidence and argument and (d) astonishing ignorance of the subject matter at hand.

Leiter begins by imagining that Arnold must be an embarrassment to the MIT economics department, where he received his Ph.D. Leiter, don of American philosophy and law rankings, is obsessed with reputation. Leiter, who does not even conceal his vain desire to be the gatekeeper of American academia, seems to care more about pedigree than intellectual quality---indeed, he often confuses the two---, and so Kling's first-rate pedigree is a problem for Leiter, since Kling says something that Leiter's pinched ideology tells him must be a pernicious falsehood. Therefore, he imagines MIT must be embarrassed.

It is a scandal that Leiter has in some measure succeeded in setting himself up as a kind of gatekeeper of reputation in philosophy. I have spoken to a number of graduate students who believe that Leiter is a loathsome creature with sophomoric politics, but who fear that getting on his bad side may harm their job prospects. And it is all-too-easy to get on Leiter's bad side.

Well, I don't know about MIT, but how about Harvard? Jeffrey Frankel

(It is, of course, a fact that Leiter in an embarrasment to members of the faculty of his own department. And it is a fact that his performance in his self-designated role as spokesperson for academic philosophy is increasingly an embarrassment to large swathes of the profession.  However, unlike Leiter, we understand that this has no bearing on the cogency of any argument he might happen to make.)

A while back a number of philosophers attacked Leiter's philosophy rankings. That's too bad, because there's nothing wrong with the rankings. They're useful.

Leiter is simply uninterested in intellectual engagment. He is as doctrinaire as they come. What he seems to be interested in is consolidating the emotive ideological commitment of his fellow-travelers by undermining the credibility they might attach to thinkers whose arguments might undermine their ideological commitment. If everyone who disagrees with Leiter's politics is in one way or another disqualified from serious intellectual consideration, then his dogmas become untouchable. It's a good game for sophists, but a disgrace for a philosopher.

The real trouble is Leiter is all-too-happy to give the impression that he can make or break young philosophers. And young philosophers are only too aware of Leiter's ideological vehemence, and his willingness to unscrupulously smear those who contradict him.  I have spoken to a number of graduate students who believe that Leiter is a loathsome creature with sophomoric politics, but who fear that getting on his bad side may harm their job prospects, and so DO NOT SPEAK UP.
