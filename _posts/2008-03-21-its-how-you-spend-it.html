One thing I'm constantly saying is that whether or not money helps make you feel better depends on what you do with it. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN2042446720080320">This study</a> says that it's nice to spend money on other people, which is, believe it or not, a way of spending money. But would spending money on other people make us happier if we didn't think it made <em>them</em> happier? Suppose we made a big circle with millions of people in it and everyone handed a $5 bill to the person on their left. Would we be happier?Â  Maybe that's why we like Social Security so much! (That's a joke. But how long before someone tries to use this study to argue that taxes make us happy?)
