I'm jetting off to Kansas City this afternoon. My beloved grandmother has no use for high-speed internet, and it's Christmas, so I probably won't be saying much.

I am going to try to get my family to take part in the sacred Festivus traditions of airing grievances and tests of strength.

Eat, drink, be merry.
