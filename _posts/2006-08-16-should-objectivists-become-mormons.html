<p>I've made this point a number of times, but apparently I'm not tired of making it, because I'm about to make it again.&nbsp;One of the tenets of Objectivism is that adherence to the principles of Objectivism is a necessary condition for true happiness and maximum longevity. I am completely confident that this is false. So I am also willing to bet that Mormons, for example,&nbsp;are on average both happier (measured according to any standard method)&nbsp;and longer lived&nbsp;than Objectivists.</p> <p>Any takers? How much you wanna bet?</p> <p>I anticipate that some will object that happiness measurement techniques are unreliable. Fair enough! But I worry some Objectivists will insist on defining happiness a bit&nbsp;circularly. Rand said happiness is "the successful state of life... that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one's values." I like it. Elsewhere we get "noncontradictory joy,"&nbsp;by which she means guilt-free joy.&nbsp;Anyway, how can we tell&nbsp;we're&nbsp;there? By noticing that we're&nbsp;in that&nbsp;joyfully guilt-free&nbsp;state of consciouness. It seems like if you were in it, you'd know it.&nbsp;That sure sounds to me like something strong enough&nbsp;to show up on surveys or experience sampling diaries. Still, I think Mormons will report feeling better. The trick is that happiness, by definition,&nbsp;comes from achieving one's (objective) values, and objective values are the necessary conditions for life ("man qua man"). Reason, the capacity of non-contradictory identification,&nbsp;is our primary instrument&nbsp;of survival and happiness, and faith is the abdication of reason. Mormons believe, well, lots of weird things, by faith,&nbsp;totally at&nbsp;odds with reality.&nbsp;So whatever state of consciousness&nbsp;Mormons are achieving, it can't <em>really </em>be happiness, now can it, since it violates allegedly practically mandatory values.&nbsp;</p> <p>But <em>you'd think</em> the "philosophy for living on Earth"&nbsp;would&nbsp;buy you some extra longevity, so it's hard to see how you would explain away Mormon dominance in life-span, if such a thing were shown to be true. (And I'll&nbsp;bet you&nbsp;it is!)&nbsp;Since one man's modus ponens is another's modus tollens, we might infer from the fact that adherence to some belief system leads to the longest, happiest lives,&nbsp;together with&nbsp;the premise that&nbsp;reason is&nbsp;our capacity of non-contradictory identification &nbsp;aimed at survival and flourishing, to the conclusion that the most life-promoting belief system <em>must</em> be endorsed by reason. So if Mormons really <em>are</em> happier and longer-lived, should Objectivists become Mormons? Or&nbsp;should&nbsp;they rather acknowledge that reason isn't necessarily <em>for </em>survival and happiness, but worth caring about all the same, and believing in Kolob or whatever isn't worth it, even it would make you happier and add a&nbsp;couple years.&nbsp;</p>
