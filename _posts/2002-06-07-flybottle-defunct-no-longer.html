<b>Flybottle: Defunct No Longer!</b> -- Have you missed me? I've missed you. I've been distracted by my work on the upcoming <a href="http://www.theihs.org/workshop/">IHS Social Change Workshop for Graduate Students</a>, and by an effort to have something of a social life. But it's not really worth it, is it? Having a life?

Well, last night blogging and life combined at the Blogorama on Kalorama, as I'll call it. A bunch of libertarian & conservative D.C. bloggers appeared, and I would link to them all, but I'm a schmuck. After, had a nice Mexican dinner at <a href="http://eg.washingtonpost.com/profile/792217/?&flavor_id=2">Lauriol Plaza</a>, with <a href="http://www.pjdoland.com/revolution/">PJ</a> and <a href="http://erin.doland.org/">Erin Doland</a>, and <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/notes.html">Julian Sanchez</a>, who managed to dump half a pitcher of frozen margaritas on his sizzling vegetable concoction. Afterwards, Julian and I, for reasons known only to the Gods, paid $5 and ascended to <a href="http://eg.washingtonpost.com/profile/792195?flavor_id=5&tmpl=1">Heaven</a> for 80's night and got our dance on.

Anyway, I'm back, at least until the week after next, when I'm gone again, to UVA for my seminar. (How many <a href="http://www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/1986/">Nobel</a> <a href="http://www.nobel.se/economics/laureates/1993/north-autobio.html">Prize</a> winners will <i>you</i> chat with next week? Huh?)
