Judging from the comments, Marketplace listeners do not seem all that receptive to the standard explanation of growing wage inequality, nor to the idea that limits on H1-B visas constitute a subsidy to domestic skilled workers that exacerbates the wage gap. Anyway, <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/07/16/skilled_workers/">that's what I argued today</a>. Here's my conclusion:
<blockquote>These days, almost everybody but their beneficiaries think agricultural subsidies are a lousy idea. They benefit a few already relatively wealthy American farmers and agribusiness firms to the detriment of poor farmers around the world. But H-1B visa restrictions are subsidies that benefit relatively rich domestic workers over their poorer foreign peers, and so it turns out many of us liberal-minded college grads are enjoying our own protectionist boost.

In this case, it seems the moral outrage is... well, we seem to be keeping it to ourselves.</blockquote>
And not only are we keeping the moral outrage to ourselves, it is apparently morally outrageous to address inequality by actually addressing the mechanisms that cause it -- the relation between the supply and demand of skill -- if that involves making some foreigners a lot wealthier.

By the way, I do not endorse the headline, "U.S. should import more skilled workers," which of course I did not choose. If you dammed up a river, then found you had too little water downstream, and so released a bit of water from the dam, you <em>could </em>think of it as "importing more water." Or you could think of it, more accurately, as removing the artificial barrier to supply.
