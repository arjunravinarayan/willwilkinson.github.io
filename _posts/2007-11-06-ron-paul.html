I gave $50 to the Ron Paul campaign yesterday, and I'm delighted he made such a huge haul. I've been critical of what I see as Paul's nationalism,Â  since I think this is incompatible with a concern for liberty. But, on balance, I cannot help but think that Paul's presence in the race as a critic of war and executive power and as a proponent of limited government more than compensates for the confusion inherent in his border-reifying sovereignty fixation. I feel hopeful that with his now-bulging war chest, he'll help keep the non-interventionist wing of the GOP vital, and make a lot of college students interested in <a href="http://www.catooncampus.org/">learning about the libertarian alternative</a>.
