Paul Zrimsek in the comments below offers us this gem: Â 
<blockquote>Last but perhaps not least among causes of the consumer funk is the administration's own determined pessimism. Mr. Bush has a bully pulpit, and he is using it to preach economic alarm. This adds powerfully to the chorus of doomsaying. And when it comes to short-term economics, believing can sometimes make it so.
