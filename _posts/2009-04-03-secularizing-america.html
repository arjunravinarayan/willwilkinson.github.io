The U.S. is surely and steadily becoming a less religious place. USA Today has <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-03-09-ARIS-faith-survey_N.htm">a groovy interactive graph</a> illustrating the following:
<blockquote>The 2008 results [of theÂ American Religious Identification Survey], to be released today, are based on 54,000 interviews with a margin of error of plus or minus 0.5%. It finds that, despite population growth and immigration adding nearly 50 million more adults, almost all denominations have lost ground since the first ARIS data was released in 1990.</blockquote>
Here's the picture of state-by-state growth in the number of people identifying as atheists, agnostics, or without a religion:

But go to the real graph for the groovy interactivity.

Secularization is part of a long trend toward moral liberalization. That the Iowa Supreme Court would unanimously rule prohibition of gay marriage illegal when a decade ago this would have seemed impossible is just one example of this very welcome trend.
