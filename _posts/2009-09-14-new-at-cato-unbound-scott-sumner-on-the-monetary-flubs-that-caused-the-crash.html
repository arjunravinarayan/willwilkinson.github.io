This month's edition of <em>Cato Unbound</em> on "The Monetary Lessons of the Not-So-Great Depression" kicks off with a probing, provocative essay by headliner Scott Sumner, "<a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/09/14/scott-sumner/the-real-problem-was-nominal/">The Real Problem Was Nominal</a>." He says things like this:
<blockquote>We cannot hope to understand what happened late last year without first recognizing that the proximate cause of the crash was not a financial crisis, but rather a steep decline in nominal spending. Like any other fall in aggregate demand, this represented a failure of monetary policy. Severe demand-side recessions are almost never the result of special interest politics — the losses are too great and too widespread — but instead represent an intellectual failure by well-meaning public servants and the academic economists who advise them.</blockquote>
And this:
<blockquote>The real problem was not a “real” problem at all. It was a nominal problem, and the severe intensification of the debt crisis was a symptom of an ordinary Humean nominal shock. Furthermore, monetary policy was not “easy” but rather was highly contractionary in the only sense that matters, that is, <em>relative to the stance expected to hit the Fed’s implicit nominal targets</em>.</blockquote>
On deck we've got <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/">James Hamilton</a>, <a href="http://www.terry.uga.edu/~selgin/">George Selgin</a>, and <a href="http://www.sjsu.edu/depts/economics/faculty/hummel/index.html">Jeff Hummel</a>.
