Regarding the debate on inequality stirred up by Tyler Cowen's excellent New York Times column, Ezra Klein writes admiringly of his colleague's effort to "refocus the inequality conversation on proper compensation for the work of individuals."
<blockquote>I genuinely can't imagine the world view that makes anyone think that, say, an academic making $120,000 a year works 400% harder than a hotel maid flipping 100+ pound Sealy Posturpedic mattresses all day for $30,000 (and no health benefits). It's certainly true society <em>values</em> the work of the academic more, but that's neither here nor there so far as its difficulty.  Indeed, that's the issue here: How we, as a society, value certain kinds of work, and how willing we are to override the Magic Market's judgment.</blockquote>
I genuinely can't imagine this world view, either. I also can't imagine the world view that makes anyone think this may be anyone else's world view. It is certainly ruled out by a rudimentary appreciation of the law of demand. But minimal comprehension of the way wages reflect the "magical" interaction between the supply and demand for particular services does not seem to be the basis of Ezra's objection. Since I can't imagine the worldview that <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> the basis of his objection, I have some questions perhaps he will answer.
<ol>
	<li>What is this <span style="font-style: italic">society</span> of which you speak, if not the network of individuals engaged in peaceful cooperation and mutual aid?</li>
	<li>Who are <span style="font-style: italic">we? </span>The legal citizens of the United States of America? All individuals who happen to fall under the legal jurisdiction of the United States of America? Americans and those outside of America to whom we are related through the network of market cooperation? Do we care about those people's compensation, too? Or just Americans? Just SEIU members?</li>
	<li>Have you discovered that it is <span style="font-style: italic">not <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem">impossible</a></span> to aggregate individual preferences in a way that provides a determinate "social" ranking of states of affairs without violating minimal conditions of rationality and liberal equality? If so, phone Stockholm! Or maybe it <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> impossible, but you want to do it anyway, which I guess <span style="font-style: italic">would </span>be magic.</li>
</ol>
Further on, Ezra writes:
<p style="margin-left: 40px">Meanwhile, I agree with <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/2007/01/post_2589.html">J.</a> that the issue of happiness is neither here nor there so far as inequality is concerned. Folks who want to blunt concern over inequality tend to digress onto unrelated ground, like how much better a low income worker does than his paleolithic forebears, or whether they're "happy."</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Did Ezra fail to notice that Tyler's point about happiness was about happiness <span style="font-style: italic">inequality. </span>As Sen famously points out, everybody care about the equality of something. Libertarians care about the inequalities of liberty and power. <span style="font-style: italic">Â </span></p>
