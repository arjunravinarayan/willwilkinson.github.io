I believe I blogged an earlier version of this paper some time ago, but the revision makes a number of strides.

[O]ne conclusion now commonly found in the literature, including in emerging textbooks, is incorrect. It is the idea that modern happiness research has established the existence of diminishing marginal utility of income.

[...]

even conceptually, we have not, as a body of researchers, established that happiness is curved in income. It is natural, arguably, to believe in the kind of curvature taught in economics textbooks (interesting evidence appears in Horowitz et al 2007, and, since the first draft of this paper, in Layard et al, 2007). Future research may find a way empirically of proving that there is diminishing marginal utility of income. Yet currently what we have done is to show that reported happiness is a concave function of income. The key point is that we do not know the shape of the function relating reported happiness to actual happiness.
