<a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/06/milton_friedman_10.html">Bryan Caplan uncovers the source</a> of that ill-considered and much-deployed Milton Friedman immigration quotation: "You cannot simultaneously have free immigration and a welfare state." it turns out Friedman <em>really </em>hadn't considered it. When, in the offending interview, Friedman is offered the alternative of a status for immigrants that specifically excludes them from eligibility for welfare, he says:
<blockquote>I haven't really ever thought of that system. It's a new question. I very rarely get a new question, but I must admit that's a new question for me. And I haven't really thought about it a great deal, but my initial reaction is that it's a very undesirable proposal.</blockquote>
Bryan rightly observes that it's really weird that an (at the time) 87 year-old policy virtuoso had never once thought about this. Sadly, it shows.

There are many things to be said about the Friedman quote. The first, other than the fact that it is evidently not a considered opinion, is that it is obviously false. The interviewer seems immediately to sense this, which perhaps explains his extending the possibility of a no-welfare "Blue Card" as a logical lifeline for Friedman to grab hold of. Residency and work rights are entirely logically and practically separable from citizenship or eligibility for subsidies or transfer payments. You can have a welfare state <em>for citizens </em>and a residency and work rights for non-citizens. So it's just false that there is even an internal tension between the welfare state and free migration. The tension is created entirely by a simple failure to keep separate issues separate. After having his prior comment decisively proven false by the evidently very real possibility raised in the follow-up question, Friedman seems to try to save himself by retreating to an uncharacteristically fuzzy-headed invocation of the value equality, which just goes to show how off-the-cuff this was. It's sad to see people who pretend to care about Friedman's intellectual legacy opportunistically make hay out of a very rare bad moment.

The second thing to say is that Friedman's false assertion is <em>irrelevant </em>to most on-the-ground political debates about immigration in which no one is arguing for free immigration. Migration restrictionists use Friedman's quip to argue against <em>more </em>immigration. But, false as it is, Friedman's quip neither says nor implies that you cannot have a <em>greater rate</em> of immigration and a welfare state. And it's a good thing too, because <em>that</em> would be false for a whole other set of reasons.

Check it out. The United States does not have an <em>especially</em> high rate of immigrants as a percentage of our population. [Click for full size]

The U.S. is <em>barely </em>ahead of Sweden and Germany, and <em>considerably </em>behind Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and, yes, Switzerland in portion of population foreign-born. All the countries in front, I hazard to guess, are more generous in terms of welfare payments than is the United States. And they all are extremely successful countries with very healthy economies. So, to repeat, there are a number of countries basically indistinguishable from the U.S. in terms of overall economic performance that have <em>both</em> larger welfare states and considerably higher rates of immigration.

Third, and last, a number of recent studies support the idea that ethnic heterogeneity somewhat undermines support for the welfare state. So, if you want to decrease the size of the welfare state, then <em>you should support higher rates of immigration</em>. Moreover, higher rates of immigration would increase nation-level income inequality (in much the way that a convention of little people will increase the height inequality in a hotel) and may hinder efforts at re-empowering unions. If you're look for something that would stick it harder to nationalist egalitarian liberals, <em>you won't find it</em>.

May Friedman's quote of shame rest in pieces.
