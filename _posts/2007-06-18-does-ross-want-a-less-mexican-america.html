Both <a href="http://www.theamericanscene.com/2007/06/does-rawlsian-nationalism-exist-i-like.php">Reihan</a> and <a href="http://larison.org/2007/06/18/wilkinsons-progressive-globalism/">Daniel Larison</a> seem to think I'm cheaply accusing Ross of some kind of nasty Mexiphobia. No. What I said is that I think Ross  is "appealing to populist class sentiments to help achieve a goal he wants anyway: a less Mexican America." 

I had thought that Ross <em>does</em> want a less Mexican America. For instance, I read <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/policyreview/3436676.html">Ross's review</a> of Samuel Huntington's <em>Who Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity</em> as buying in to the main thesis that America's national identity is Anglo-Protestant, that it underpins much of what is good about America, and that Mexican migration threatens it. Ross's sensible attitude is both less alarmed and more resigned than Huntington's; he thinks erosion of national identity is too bad, but not <em>that</em> bad, and that there's not <em>a lot </em>we can do about it. But, yes, a less Mexican America would be good for American national identity, which would be good for America. Things aren't as bad as Huntington thinks, but, Ross writes, "<span class="text1">What decay there is lies within, in 'the challenges to America’s national identity' that Huntington so ably describes." The challenges Huntington so ably describe have a lot to do with an imagined invasion of Mexicans. </span>

<span class="text1"></span><span class="text1">When I googled The American Scene, seeking confirmation of my sense of Ross's views, I did <a href="http://www.theamericanscene.com/2006/01/consequences-of-economic-growth-peter.php">turn this up</a>, which seems a clearer endorsement of Huntington's thesis than the review itself:
<p class="pDeptbodycopy">
<blockquote>
<p class="pDeptbodycopy"><span class="text1">If we're concerned about the collapse of a common culture, and <a href="http://www.theamericanscene.com/pubs/pr10-1104.html">the eclipse of our national identity</a>, we need to recognize that this eclipse is as much as result of free trade (and our present free-market approach to immigration) as of declining patriotism and left-wing identity politics.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<span class="text1">Now, Ross's conditional formulation is characteristically circumspect, so if he really doesn't think Mexican immigration -- independent of its effects on patterns of income -- is a problem for American national identity, he can say so, and I'll try to believe him. But I don't think I'm being unfair. </span>
