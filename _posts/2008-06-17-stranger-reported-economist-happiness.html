<a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1121099">This paper</a> from the May 2008 edition of Kyklos [<a href="http://www.crema-research.ch/papers/2007-16.pdf">ungated</a>] just may be the best paper ever written. It investigates the happiness of economics Nobel Prize winners, non-Nobel superstar economists, and prominent happiness researchers by showing their website photographs to people on the street in <strike>Melbourne</strike> Brisbane, Australia. Thus it contains winning lines such as:
<blockquote>[T]he advice for young academics is: if you seek happiness, become a macro-economist and research happiness; a Nobel Prize does not make you happier; if you want to be popular with the ladies, take lessons from Edmund Phelps, Bruno Frey and Richard Easterlin; if you are looking for the ability to age like a red wine, Joseph Stiglitz and Jean Tirole have the trick, but not Richard Easterlin.</blockquote>
Who, according to the good people of <strike>Melbourne</strike> Brisbane, is the happiest economist? Well, who do you think? [Click for full size.]

That's right, Edmund Phelps. That man is clearly loving life.

Congratulations to the authors for this exemplary piece of social science!
