You might notice I've been making some long-needed changes. I'm not done customizing the template, which will probably include adding some color, and so I don't think it will look so NYTimesy -- unless you like that. So please tell me what you think. I'm open to recommendations. Sadly, I don't think I have permission to use the nice picture of me that's in the sidebar, but the guy who took it for Forbes lives just up the street and says he'll give me an Kerry a good deal, and so whatever much more hideous thing I put up in the meantime shouldn't have to last long. You'll notice there are now tabs with links to my Marketplace commentaries and Bloggingheads appearances, as well as a Media tab that will have links to other stuff, like podcasts and public events for which there's audio and or video. O' vanity!
