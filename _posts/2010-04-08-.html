Krugman writes:
<blockquote>The basic picture of the federal government you should have in mind is that it’s essentially a huge insurance company with an army; Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid — all of which spend the great bulk of their funds on making payments, not on administration — plus defense are the big items. Salaries aren’t.

But the Kudlow picture [according to which cuts in government salaries would be fiscally significant] is nonetheless a key part of conservative imagery; the idea of vast rooms full of government employees doing nothing productive is central to their vision of painless spending cuts. The fact that it’s not remotely true is irrelevant; they want it to be true, and that’s enough.</blockquote>
I think Krugman's basic picture of the federal government is about right. (Reminds me of Chomsky's definition of a language: a dialect with a navy.) The reasons to complain about government salaries are three. (1) Efficiency and justice. If the government can do something , it must.
