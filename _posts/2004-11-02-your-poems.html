Wow! Donations are rolling into The Fly Bottle taking me up on offers for personalized poems. You won't be sorry! That said, it may take me a couple of days to write your poem. I'm rather distracted today by some good news, and the elections. But I'll get on it tomorrow. Some poems will require research. For instance, I must now learn something about Halo II in order to write an ode to it.
