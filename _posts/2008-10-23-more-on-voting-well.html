Brown political philosopher<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/audio/2008/oct/23/political-philosophy"> Jason Brennan chats with the Guardian </a>the about what it means to vote well.

I owe a lot of my thinking on this to Jason, and we both owe a lot to Bryan Caplan's <em>Myth of the Rational Voter</em>.  

I was just on the radio, News Talk Radio 580 CRFA in Ottawa, talking about this. I consider this my effort at civic engagement as a potentially future Canadian.
