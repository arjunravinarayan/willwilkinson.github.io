On Monday, my new, weekly Bloggingheads TV show, Free Will, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/7753">debuted</a> with special guest Kerry Howley. On Tuesday, The New York Times <a href="http://video.on.nytimes.com/?fr_story=588a2dc1e04102d5542db2a9fac6c7085bc1e08e">excerpted a bit of our conversation</a> on sex trafficking. Today, I argued for a common North American labor market in my <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/01/09/wilkinson_commentary/">commentary on Marketplace</a>. I'll be on every other Wednesday!
