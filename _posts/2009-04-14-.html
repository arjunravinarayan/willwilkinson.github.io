Matthew Schmitz, the managing editor of <em>The Public Discourse, </em>was not thrilled with my reply to Justin Barnard's piece in his publication. 
<blockquote>I can’t blame Will Wilkinson for wanting a world in which human bodies can be treated more and more like machines that need to be calibrated for maximum efficiency. Wilkinson’s essentially economic viewpoint sees man as a producer and consumer actualized by choice and validated by his productivity.

CEDs are the perfect pills for a society that has trouble assigning value on any basis other than productivity. They do for work what the pill did for sex: free it from the constraints of human life. Work will become detached from a larger framework of rest, nutrition and leisure. This imperative is already pervasive on college campuses. During my not-too-distant days on campus I had several friends who took Adderall and others aptly-named study drugs. The chemical tools of the ’60s counterculture have been commandeered by the elite to squeeze more work out of the youths they were supposed to liberate. <em>Opium</em> ended up being the opiate of the masses, and escape became enslavement. We have now reached the point where we would actually have a richer view of human experience if we returned to the days of recreational drug use.</blockquote>
But it <em>was </em>a terrible argument, wasn't it Matt?

Anyway, I don't recall saying or implying that I want "a world in which human bodies can be treated more and more like machines that need to be calibrated for maximum efficiency." And there is no sense in
