I was going to leave a comment on <a href="http://publicreason.net/2008/02/14/a-quick-thought-on-utilitarianism-non-ideal-theory-sweatshops-and-distributive-justice/">this post</a> by Nicole Hassoun, but apparently the power to comment is restricted to those who have finished their dissertations. (Really! <a href="http://publicreason.net/wp-login.php?action=register">Try it</a>.) I feel somewhat chastened by my lack of academic accomplishment, but I thought I would comment anyway. Here is Dr. Hassoun:
<blockquote>It seems to me that there are times when we might do best (even on utilitarian grounds) not to do what would maximize utility in non-ideal circumstances. Consider an instance in which this point may have practical bite. Some argue against ending child labor because the children we prohibit from working may suffer more for our good intentions. Child prostitution may be their second best option. But that this would be so, holding everything else fixed, does not mean we should not try to end child labor. What it shows is that we should try to end child labor and help educate the children we liberate. If one says that we do not have the resources to do this then we should reply that we can and need to find the resources â€” that is what justice requires.</blockquote>
This little half-paragraph seems to manage to (1) fail to understand what 'cannot' means, (2) fail to understand that resources are not simply "found", (3) betray a uselessly unrealistic conception of the efficacy of collective action.

It also seems to me to misunderstand what ideal theory amounts to, but I think everybody does that.

Regarding (1): Suppose you say that, for whatever reason, I'm duty-bound to be in Tokyo in a half-hour. I say that there's no way I can do it; it's impossible. So you say, "learn to teleport -- that  is what morality requires."  What would you make of that?

Maybe that's not fair. But it strikes me that the idea here is that if a certain policy just moves the lump in the rug, well, then just reweave the whole damn rug so it doesn't have a lump in it. That is, if this unwanted side-effect obtains <em>holding everything else fixed</em>, well then unfix everything until it goes away! Generally we can't do that.

Sometimes we can't get things done because we can't all agree to do it. Even the guys with guns who are supposed to round up all the other people and force them to do what they're supposed to often can't all agree to work together in a way that gets the job done.  Who will point guns at the guys with the guns!? Big projects with a goal but no coherent incentive structure quickly turn into goat rodeos. This sort of limit on feasible social action certainly does frustrate people. If five of us can team up to put on a show to save the school, then why can't a billion of us team up to end hunger or meanness. I mean, can't we just <em>try</em> harder? The answer is usually, "yes we can try harder, and we still can't manage to do it." This isn't a metaphysical or even physical sense of 'can't'. If justice requires an unbroken human chain of a billion people holding hands, then it can't be done. Of course, a conception of justice that doesn't grasp elementary limits on the coordination of many different people with many different ideas about what they ought to be doing isn't a conception that applies.

That all brings us right to (3): As my old friend Matt Zwolinski asks in his comment, who exactly is this "we"? But suppose we're game, whoever we are. How do we dispose of our duty? The idea appears to be, what? (a) make child labor illegal, (b) educate all the children so they don't go into sex work. Well, what could go wrong? I mean, I guess (b) is superfluous, right, since we've banned child labor already, and sex work is work? Anyway, who enforces all these rules? Who writes them? How did those people get to decide what the rules were going to be? Who finances all this? What is the agency that collects the taxes? What is the process by which it is determined that taxes will be levied? Etc. This isn't all stuff you figure out <em>after</em> you've figured out what justice requires. It's stuff you have to think through to do ideal theory in the first place. You've got to think about would it mean for everything to go as well as possible without slipping into the pointlessly utopian. You don't start with how nice it would be if kids didn't have to work and then just demand that all the relevant constraints vanish.

Regarding (2): What are the resources supposed to be for? To pay the special child labor police to crack down on the factories employing children? To pay the massive cadre of ex-child-laborer educators? Perhaps the resources are required to compensate all the families of all the children for the lost wages, which would have the virtue of making some kind of sense. (And besides getting poor kids out of work, it would surely give the gift of existence to a bunch of new poor kids.) The idea that if "we" don't have enough resources, then "we" should just<em> look harder</em> is certainly an idea one could have. Of course, the best way to get these resources is to actually produce them. And the best way to get kids out of child labor is to help implement the institutions known to create wealth, so that eventually children are not seen as economic assets of the parents, but as persons with unique potential parents have a special, loving interest in developing.

Anyway, sometimes its good to be reminded of why economists make fun of philosophers.
