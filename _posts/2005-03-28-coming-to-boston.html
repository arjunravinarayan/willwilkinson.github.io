I'll be giving a talk on "Pluralism, Sympathy, and Lifestyle Entrepreneurship" or something along those lines, at the Boston University Libertarian Society's imaginatively named Liberty Conference on Saturday April 9th. If you'll be in Boston, or across the river among the dorks and snots, please come by. I aim to edify.

I just thought of something Boston-related that I think is funny to do. When you get in a conversation with somebody, and it gets to the "where'd you go to school phase", and they say with excruciatingly mannered evasiveness "Oh, up in Boston," reply, "Oh sure, Northeastern's a really great school," and walk away. Fun!
