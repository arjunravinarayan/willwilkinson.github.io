Tyler <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/07/banned_in_the_u.html">notes that I'm banned</a> in Dubai. I would like to say it's because of my dangerous liberatory political ideas. More likely, though, it's because of the pornographic trackback spam that has infested my archives. No, I like the first idea. UAE: You can't <em>handle</em> the truth!
