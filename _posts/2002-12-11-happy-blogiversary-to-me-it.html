<b>Happy Blogiversary to Me!</b>-- It doesn't seem that long ago, but The Fly Bottle is now over a year old. (It was November 23, to be exact). This is a pretty low-volume, low-traffic site, and Instapundit and others get more hits in a day or so than I've seen in a year.... nonetheless, I think it's nice that I've had 40,000 hits since I've started.
