Regarding the supply-side foofaraw, I loved this comment by "8" on <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/09/the-demand-side.html#comments">this Alex Tabarrok post</a>:
<blockquote>How hard is this to understand? The taxpayer doesn't care about maximizing government revenue.

Politician A: Mr. Joe Sixpack, we can maximize government revenue by raising taxes by 10%, because you see, we'll only lose 9% to slower growth, so our revenue actually increases! Then we can spend it in lots of ways to make you happy!

Joe Sixpack: So, you're raising taxes by 10% <em>and</em> you're going to slow the economy?

Poltician A: Don't look so glum! It's for the children!

Politician B: Me cut taxes. You keep money, economy grow fast. Ugh. Me like cookie.

Joe Sixpack: I pick B.</blockquote>
That pretty much gets to the heart of this. Or, as <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12201">NBER chief Martin Feldstein puts it</a>:
<blockquote>
<p align="left">financing additional government spending by an acrosss the board rise in all marginal tax rates would make the cost per dollar of government spending equal to $1.76.</p>
<p align="left">These two facts -- that the actual revenue is only 57 percent of the static gain and that the deadweight loss is 76 cents per dollar of revenue -- should be central to any consideration of tax policy. And yet they are not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">It is <em>possible </em>that<em> </em>the state can make its citizens better off by taking $1.76 to spend $1.00, if those very expensive dollar bills are spent on highly valuable public goods folks can't coordinate to provide privately. But I reckon this kind of bona fide public good is a pretty small part of the existing budget.</p>
<p align="left">Also,  people's money is, well,  <em>their money</em>, and it is obviously wrong for other people to take it from them absent a special justification. If the government is taking more than is justified, then it should cut taxes and cut spending. It happens that the government <em>is</em> taking more than is justified. So it should cut taxes and cut spending. It seems like a number of folks on the left are practically hyperventilating with excitement over this supply side business, but it strikes me that 8 has both the economics and the politics right.</p>
