I am not now, nor have I ever been, <a href="http://www.jacobgrier.com/blog/archives/000332.html">an acrobat</a>.

[Update: The mysterious Fey Accompli <a href="http://www.feyaccompli.com/index.php?p=25">vouches for my authenticity</a>. Now, regarding the <a href="http://catallarchy.net/blog/archives/2005/02/13/libertarian-girl-mystery/">Libertarian Girl debacle</a>, it may be that I know all of the extremely attractive libertarian women in existence, although I am very glad to doubt it, but there are a passel of ladies of my acquaintance who put the mail-order bride to shame. (Fey, by the way, is loveliest of them all.) Why all the fuss for a 7.5?]
