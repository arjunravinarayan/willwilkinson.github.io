Along with <a href="http://www.tomgpalmer.com/archives/015129.php">Tom Palmer</a>, <a href="http://www.affbrainwash.com/genehealy/">Gene Healy</a>, <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/">Don Boudreaux</a> and distinguished non-blogging others, I'm off to Quebec City for the Cato University seminar on the "<a href="http://www.cato-university.org/">Art of Persuasion</a>." Blogging forecast: 65% chance of light blogging; 35% chance of none.  Depends on the hook up in <a href="http://www.fairmont.com/frontenac/">le Ch√¢teau Frontenac</a>.

Tom, being a St. John's man, has been revisting the classics of rhetoric. I, not being a St. John's man, have been revisiting Rodney Stark on conversion, George Lakoff on political mental models, and the social network and diffusions of innovations literature. I promised Tom I wouldn't give a talk that sounds like it ought to have a title like "Prolegomena to a Hermeneutics of Meme Exchange," and I won't!, but it's been a real challenge distilling all this stuff into something engaging and accessible. Wish me luck!
