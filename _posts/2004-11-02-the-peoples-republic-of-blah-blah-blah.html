From a friend in Berkeley:

<blockquote>So the guy who hands me my voting card is wearing an old
t-shirt with President Bush Sr. drowning, his head barely
out of the ocean, gasping, with the line "Ohhhh!"  The guy
says, "Yeah, it's okay because it's Bush Senior!"  Welcome to
Berkeley, California.</blockquote>
