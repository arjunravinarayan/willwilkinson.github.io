Check out the <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/08/05/jorge-castaneda/a-us-war-with-mexican-consequences/">hot-off-the-Wordpress lead essay</a> for the new edition of Cato Unbound by former Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs Jorge Castañeda. Here's his gist:
<blockquote>In his lead essay, Jorge Castañeda observes that the consequences of the U.S. drug war fall unevenly on Mexico. The U.S. taste for drugs — and for prohibition — are the chief causes of drug-related crime in Mexico, he asserts. This creates a problem that Mexico cannot solve on its own. U.S. assistance has been insufficient, and Mexican resources are too few to take on the drug cartels effectively. Even if the resources were available, the militarization of life in Mexico would be politically unacceptable to most Mexicans, who have enjoyed a relatively tranquil military in contrast to many other Latin American countries. Another approach to the war on drugs would simply be decriminalization, but again, Mexico cannot unilaterally decriminalize, because it would face severe diplomatic consequences from the United States and possibly become a refuge for addicts. The United States must lead the way toward solving this problem, which is of its own making.</blockquote>
