Chris of <a href="http://mixingmemory.blogspot.com/">Mixing Memory</a> has initiated a series of posts on cognitive science and moral psychology. The first post, which asks, "<a href="http://mixingmemory.blogspot.com/2005/07/moral-psychology-i-where-is-morality.html">where is morality in the brain</a>," is good. I'm looking forward to the rest, which, Chris says, will address all this stuff:

<blockquote>Hopefully, by the time I'm done, you will have some idea of what the intuitionist view of moral judgment is, in what ways moral psychology and moral philosophy should interact, and who, if anyone, might be a moral expert. There are a bunch of other issues that I'll try to touch on as well. Is morality a natural kind in the brain, or to use a stranger label, a cognitive kind? How much influence does conscious reasoning have on our moral judgments and behavior? How does communication affect moral judgment?</blockquote>
