Since I'm giving recommendations, let me direct your attention to a great newish blog, Fey Accompli, where you can find a singular mix of finely crafted political commentary, literary analysis, ruminations on marketing &amp; business &amp; fashion, and poetic spiritual reflection. Be sure to check out this post about "special music" at Sunday service. I remember wowing the reverently assembled with "Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?" around this time of year some many years ago. The correct answer, I think, is "No, I was not there, but Jim Caviezel was." But the point was, Fey Accompli, good. Joanna is pretty pretty. Fey is ineffable.
