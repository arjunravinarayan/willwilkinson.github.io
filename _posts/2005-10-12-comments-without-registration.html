<p>Because MT 2.3 has considerably better spam controls, I thought I'd experiment in removing the registration barrier for comments. <br /></p><p>The new version has a &quot;folder&quot; for comment and trackback spam, and I'm absolutely amazed by the quantity of it. I appear to be getting about one spam comment a minute, but so far, the levee is holding. So we'll see how it goes.  <br /></p>
