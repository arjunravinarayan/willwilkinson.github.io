IN the course of a discussion of the merit of markets for organs, Harvard economist Alvin Roth writes:
<blockquote>It is <a href="http://vote98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/6.htm">illegal to sell horsemeat for human consumption in California</a>, not because a persuasive case was made that the costs exceed the benefits, but <a href="http://vote98.sos.ca.gov/Returns/prop/00.htm">because 4,670,524 people voted</a> to make it illegal in a 1998 referendum. This and <a href="http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/%7Earoth/papers/Repugnance.pdf">many other examples</a> persuade me there is something about repugnance that we economists need to understand.</blockquote>
To get a better grip on repugnance, I would recommend Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley's <a href="http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/Haidt.disgust-handbook.pdf">review article on disgust</a> [pdf]in <em>The Handbook of Emotions</em>. (You didn't know there was a handbook, did you? It comes in handy.) Repugnance is fascinating, but it seems to me like a special case of the general phenomenon of what I'll scientifically call "weird preferences".

One of the most pervasive forms of government failure is the prohibition of markets that would improve wellbeing because voters find the very existence of such markets objectionable due to weird preferences based in disgust, coalitional identification, and a fixation on hierarchy.

The

Can a horsemeat ban possibly be efficient? If Pareto is our guide to efficiency, then it seems it cannot. But this is largely because the ban is based in preferences that violate the enabling conditions for Pareto efficiency. We need individuals' preferences to be suitably independent of one another. But horsemeat bans and the like are based in what Amartya Sen called "meddlesome" preferences.

Now, restrictions like horse-meat bans, or neighborhood segregation by race, of discrimination might in fact be efficiency maximising given strong preferences against horse-eating, employing women, living in the same neighborhood as a minority, or what have you.
Two kinds of weird preferences cause special problems: meddlesome preferences--preferences over what <em>other</em> people do--and discr

The problem is that such preferences meddlesome, as Amartya Sen puts it. <em>I </em>have a preference that <em>you </em>don't eat horse. But why should my preferences over what <em>you </em>do get any weight at all. If you want to eat horse, you should eat horse. If the only harm
