Luka points me to this LAT article on the possibility of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-poll21jul21,1,6543600.story">Badnarik as spoiler</a>. NPR Morning Edition <a href="http://www.npr.org/rundowns/segment.php?wfId=4118051">also discusses</a> this tantalizing possibility.

Now, to repeat, the fact that Badnarik, despite his nuttiness, is in any position whatsoever to screw Bush simply highlights how much the LP botched it this year.

In other news, <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/archives/2004_10_20.html#008239">Jeff Jarvis recommends</a> that sane libertarian bloggers take over the LP. Good idea!

But don't forget to vote for Badnarik.
