At one point, progressives were arguing <em>angrily</em> and <em>self-righteously </em>that the failure to pass a Democratic HCR bill would cost many tens of thousands of lives, and that therefore, in the event of failure, those impeding the passage of such a bill would have blood on their hands. It has now been established that the failure of Democratic HCR efforts cannot be reasonably expected to have any such dramatic effect. Indeed, it is now a point of legitimate contention whether extending insurance to the currently uninsured would do anything at all to reduce mortality within that group. Progressives have been marched <em>all the way back</em> to arguing that the preponderance of evidence seems to indicate that insuring the presently insured would indeed have some small positive effect on mortality.

Thus cornered, <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/matthewyglesias/~3/VQ-eHR2SBEg/yes-health-insurance-saves-lives.php">Matt Yglesias growls</a>:
<blockquote>[T]o be even having this conversation is for the right-wing point of view to win the argument. It’s like the fake climate change “debate”—the point is not so much to actually persuade anyone of anything but simply to shift the rhetoric around. ... There’s obviously a lot of discomfort with the idea of a highly moralized debate about the values implicated in the decision to support or resist efforts to expand access to affordable health insurance, so creating an air of technical controversy around the fact that the exact degree to which lack of insurance is harmful helps resterilize things.</blockquote>
This is just ridiculously insulting. First, opponents of Democratic HCR efforts are accused of the passive equivalent of genocide. When it is shown that this accusation is baseless, and proponents of reform are left scrambling for evidence that reform will save lives <em>at all</em>, its opponents (right-wingers!) are then accused of intellectual bad faith for having stirred up a "technical controversy."

Yes, to be having the conversation about whether HCR can be expected to save any lives at all is for progressives to have lost the argument. Because progressives <em>lost the argument. </em>I don't think it would be unreasonable for those of of us implicitly accused of aiding and abetting mass death to ask for an apology. But I'd settle for a straightforward concession of error from those who started and then lost this debate.
