<b>Nader Spotting</b> -- Filled with renewed resolve to finish my grad studies, I jumped off the Metro at Farragut West after work to see if the Borders on 18th and L had Michael Bratman's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1575861925/qid=1016682357/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-6633005-4487116"><i>Intentions, Plans, and Practical Reason</i></a>. They didn't. But they did have... Nader, in the flesh, getting interviewed by some nebbish NPR-ish sounding chap about his new book, <i>Crashing the Party</i>.

Ralph started off badly. He was trying to make some kind of point about the populist appeal of his brand of leftist crankery, and came up with a trainwreck of an example in the form of (in Ralph's words) <i><b>Dirty</b> White Men</i>, Michael Moore's new book. (I'm surprised he didn't call him 'Roger'.) According to Nader, Moore's book has had "no publicity," aside from a "brief appearance" on Politically Incorrect, yet somehow managed to rocket to the top of the NYT bestseller list. I laughed audibly, and the assembled alpaca-clad zealots riddled me with sally of annoyed gazes. I was astonished. Really! You don't need to watch <i>much</i> TV to have noticed Moore's relentless media whoring of his latest achievement in letters. He's been <i>ubiquitous</i>. At this point I would regard a Moore appearance in a <a href="http://muscleweb.com/john/">John Basedow</a> commercial with nonchalance. ("Tired of looking like a disheveled, hypocritical swine? Try Fitness Made Simple!")  Anyway, bad start.

He went on to say some stupid things about AIDS drugs and "Big Pharma," and the meaning of freedom. However, I found myself ultimately disappointed by repeated agreement... about the two party system; about corporate welfare; about the grotesqueness of the "Patriot Act." And that was just no fun. And I was hungry. So I decamped and read my new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521795486/qid=1016684221/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/104-6633005-4487116">Peter van Inwagen book</a> over fogged glasses and a huge bowl of steaming curry lakhsa at the <a href="http://216.33.101.120/dining/Profiles/kopitiam.html">Malaysian place</a> up the street. It's pretty hard to stay annoyed at a benighted busybody like Nader while enjoying the fruits of the land: huge chain bookstores, funny analytic philosophers, savory curried soups.
