Today on Marketplace, <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/04/23/wilkinson_food_crisis/">a love letter to my home state</a>, which was once the breadbasket of the world, but is now in the business of starving poor people. Oh, it's not really about you, Iowa. It's about how politics starves poor people. You just got caught in the middle, Iowa, and I'll always love you.
