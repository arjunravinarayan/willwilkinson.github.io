Arnold Kling <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2005/02/capital_vs_inst.html">also discusses</a> the Daley/Hooks microfinance piece. But the valedictory Kling question poses a false alternative:

<blockquote><em>For Discussion</em>. Which is an easier problem to solve--a shortage of capital, or institutional deficiencies?</blockquote>

I think it's increasingly apparent that institutions <em>are</em> a form of capital. Money and machines are more or less useless, aren't really capital at all, in the absence of a system of formal and informal rules that enables extended, stable mutually beneficial coordination. That was my largely point in <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/012604D.html">this TCS article</a> on the prospects of success in Iraq, and I'm sticking to it.
