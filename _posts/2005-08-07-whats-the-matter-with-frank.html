Thomas Frank <a href="http://bookclub.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/7/28/15659/8497">at TPM Cafe</a>:

<blockquote>Times of overwhelming economic insecurity like the present ought to be times when Democrats of this variety prosper, when their values and their message find enthusiastic audiences around the country.</blockquote>

Is he <em>drunk</em>? "Times of overhwelming economic insecurity"? The sad thing is he wishes it was true, because he thinks if it was, then folks would be buying what he's selling. Lucky for all of us that it's not, and folks aren't.

But I must say, I love the daily TPM Cafe festival of indignant wishful thinking. Pundit's fallacy central!
