<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200810/adultery-porn/2">Sigh</a>. Moreover, a cigarette is suicide, the minimum wage is chattel slavery, and novels are full of lies, lies, lies!  <a href="http://kerryhowley.com/2008/09/17/trying-really-hard-to-get-upset-about-pornography/">Kerry points out the insulting, should-be-obvious implication</a> of the Douthatian position:
<blockquote>It would follow that almost all of us have experienced monogamy as a series of small treacheries and degradations of which we are barely aware. We lack the cognizance to understand that porn constitutes a breach of trust; we don’t understand the agreements we’ve entered into, their terms having been set without our knowledge. Our relationships are constantly under attack, our closest bonds assailed, and we carry on in a cloud of misbegotten contentment.

This is silly.</blockquote>
Indeed. Ross's position still completely mystifies me in terms of psychology, morality, logic, and if there is something else in play, it mystifies me in those terms, too.
