So, just the other day, I discovered that we have a view of the Washington Monument! It's not amazing, but you can see it. (The graininess is due to the electronic zoom.)

<a title="Monument View" class="imagelink" href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/monument.jpg"><img alt="Monument View" id="image892" src="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/monument.jpg" /></a>

More pictures below the fold. <!--more--> <a title="9thandEuclid.jpg" class="imagelink" href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/9thandEuclid.jpg"><img alt="9thandEuclid.jpg" id="image894" src="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/wp-content/uploads/2006/02/9thandEuclid.jpg" /></a>

Here's the view straight out our office window looking down 9th St. toward the Howard U dorms. The building on the left is Banneker High School. And that's my 1996 Honda Civic, Buchephalus. You can see the tiny, distant monument at the very right.

I just like how this tree looks like its got little christmas ornaments hanging from it.

And here's one from inside. This is our little living room. And I'm sitting on the couch <em>right now!</em>

Enjoy the snow!
