From <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2008/07/pick_your_poison.cfm">one of The Economist's New York correspondents</a>:
<blockquote>There seems to be a temptation lately to label anyone who even dares mention supply-side economics, without immediately deeming it the silliest idea born to a napkin, an economic heretic. That's unfortunate. True, with the exception of very high marginal tax rates, a tax cut will generally not pay for itself. But there exists ample empirical evidence that cutting income taxes <a title="supply side" href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/SupplySideEconomics.html" target="_blank">does increase growth</a>. Thus, the long-run impact of a permanent tax cut is still up for debate. The effect of lower-income tax rates on labour supply is mixed. But it does seem, at the very least, lower tax rates decrease the amount <a title="supply side" href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp0807.pdf" target="_blank">of tax evasion</a>. Writing off supply-side economics as a blatant fallacy is as much of a 1990s relic as wearing a goatee.</blockquote>
Nice.
