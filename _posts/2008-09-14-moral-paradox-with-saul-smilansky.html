On <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/14400">this week's Free Will</a>, I chat with Saul Smilansky about his new book <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/140516087X?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=140516087X&amp;adid=0PK53RCNQ73JSYZZ7AWZ&amp;">Ten Moral Paradoxes</a>. </em>This is a really fun, stimulating read.
