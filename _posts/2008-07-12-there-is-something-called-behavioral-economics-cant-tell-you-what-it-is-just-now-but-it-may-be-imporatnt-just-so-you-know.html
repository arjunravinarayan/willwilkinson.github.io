I can't say what the point of this less than coherent video from Gallup was, other than to mention that Gallup is at the forefront of measuring things in interesting new ways, but I thought some of you might find it interesting anyway:

[Update... Oh, this one is a little better, sort of. They could use a copywriter who doesn't have to guess so much about what the point of all this is.]

You'll be relieved to see that the guy from Singapore is interested in measuring life satisfaction in order to allow you (the ruling class of a country like, say, Singapore) to "harness the total capacity of your people." The Australian is interested in "chomping down the policies so we can drive people the right way." Huh?
