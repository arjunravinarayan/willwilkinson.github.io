In <a href="http://www.theweek.com/article/index/94981/I_smoke_pot_and_I_like_it">my latest column for The Week</a>, I argue that the drug war is stupid, deadly, and unjust and try to do my small part to normalize marijuana use. My <a href="http://www.jossip.com/some-libertarian-admits-to-smoking-pot-wholl-follow-in-the-marijuana-revolution-20090403/">favorite reaction so far comes from Jossip</a>:
<blockquote>Holy shit Wilkinson, you're really putting yourself on the line buddy! A upper-class, white Libertarian admits to smoking pot. (But does he listen to NPR? Even better: He's on it!) Since this might actually (<em>god we hope</em>) take off as the next P.C. activist trend (<em>that would be hysterical</em>), here are the next media figures to emerge from the cannabis closet.</blockquote>
And then there's a list of Hollywood types I am embarrassed to be flattered to be listed among. It's true I don't have a lot to lose. My employer's response to a column titled "I smoke pot, and I like it," is to send it out to a list of thousands as a "Cato Daily Commentary." But you've got to expect people in a safe place to make the not-especially-brave early moves in the de-stigmatization game. Neverthless, I think the demonstration effect is important. I'm no "stoner" (not that there's anything wrong with that). I'm an overeducated, relatively successful professional with a closet full of suits. How freaking square do I look in my byline picture at The Week? The stigma can't last long when <em>that's</em> the picture of a typical marijuana user. If this would "take off as the next P.C. activist trend" that would be terrific as well as hysterical. But I know for a fact that tons of P.C.-bashing Republican types smoke weed too, and it would be even better if <em>they</em> would stand and be counted.
