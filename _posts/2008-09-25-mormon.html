"So you're Mormon, then?"

"Well, not exactly. I'm in the <em>Reorganized </em>Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints."

Puzzled: "Oh."

"You see, when Joseph Smith, the founder of both churches, was murdered..."

This exchange was an intermittent refrain of my wonder years. I was always having it -- at six, ten, seventeen.  When the question was put to me, <em>Mormon</em> tended to get a superfluous and probably unintended emphasis, lending the usually innocent query a tone of minor accusation, of a probe for shame at my inexplicable oddness. I actually relished the small correction, highlighting my truly supererogatory deviance by introducing and embracing a minor subcategory of strange. I got pretty good at it.

"<em>We</em> stayed in the Midwest, waiting for Joesph Smith's son to become a man, so he could take over from his dad. <em>We</em> didn't go to Utah with Brigham Young, who was very vulgar, by the way. <em>We </em>never practiced polygamy. <em>We</em> don't perform secret rites or wear funny underwear. <em>We </em>don't pester people at home.<em> </em>Our <em>example</em> is our testimony. We believe in the <em>Book of Mormon</em>, yeah, but I'm not really Mormon in the way everyone understands."

I took comfort in both the fact that I was more exotic than a regular Mormon -- "No, not 'reformed'...<em> 'reorganized</em><em>'"  -- </em>but also less doctrinally weird, much more like a Presbyterian than the boy Deacons down at the Ward.  But when I went to work for my church over my first two college summer terms -- first in Nauvoo, then in Kirtland -- and ended up learning too much of the truth, I came to wish, I guess a bit perversely, that I'd been a real Mormon all along.

To have once believed that Heavenly Father (and Mother!) lives on Kolob and that I too would be rewarded with dominion over a celestial realm of my own -- that makes for a better story than having been part of the non-Polygamist, non-Exodusizing, non-eternally-marrying Mormons, even if Brigham Young really was a douche. At least I can say that as a lad I did believe the Navajo and Choctaw descended from Jews who came over the Atlantic in boats. That's something! But I was never really proud to not have ridiculous magical underwear. I wanted magical underwear. "Mormon" is something I sort of was, but not really. Something I both claim and reject. A leather-bound Book of Mormon embossed with my initials sits on my bookshelf. But my memory is dissapointingly ungirded.
