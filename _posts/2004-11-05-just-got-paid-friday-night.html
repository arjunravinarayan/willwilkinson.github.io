I need to go spend the evening with my special lady. Now, this is, technically, my third post for the day, but is not, I admit, ultimately consistent with the spirit of SuperNovember. But I'll now pay my respects to the letter of the law, and later do justice to the spirit. Tomorrow we'll be skipping up to Baltimore to check out the <a href="http://www.avam.org/">American Visionary Art Museum</a>. I will post in the late afternoon.
