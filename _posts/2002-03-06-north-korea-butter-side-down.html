<b>North Korea: Butter Side Down</b> -- Here's stupidity so flourescent your eyeballs will burn... Slate <a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2062841">asked a bunch of folks what book they would foist upon their city</a>. Check this:

<blockquote><b>Cindy Chupak, writer/executive producer of <i>Sex and the City</i></b>
<i>The Butter Battle Book </i>by Dr. Seuss for Washington, D.C. (just to remind President Bush that some people in the "Axis of Evil" simply butter their bread butter side down). </blockquote>
Does she KNOW that thousands upon thousands of North Koreans have been <i>starving to death</i> for <i>years</i> due to a monomaniacal totalitarian communist dictator? Butter side down? <b>BUTTER SIDE DOWN</b>!!!? Yeah, if the state decides to <i>give</i> you butter. If you aren't already <b>dead</b>. Jesus.
