Sometimes typos really improve a sentence. I snorted lemonade out my nose today when I read this:

<blockquote>Taking one example of a disorder that is "obvious from surface features," Inhibited Female Orgasm, Wakefield applauds the authors of <em>DSM-III-R</em> for discriminating between those cases in which women fail to have organisms from inadequate stimulation and those involving true dysfunction.</blockquote>

Isn't that just wonderful?!

From Dominic Murphy and Robert L. Woolfolk, "The Harmful Dysfunction Analysis of Mental Disorder," <em>Philosophy, Psychiatry, & Psychology</em>, Vol. 7, No. 4 (December 2000).
