<a href="http://www.philosophers.co.uk/games/britney_spears.htm">Fun interactive quiz</a> at The Philosophers' Magazine on the nature of great art. You get to rate several criteria for aesthetic worth in importance, then you pick the two best artists (in your opinion) from a list (you can pick Britney!) Then, you rate your two using the aethetic criteria, and the quiz tells you who you should think is the better artist. For instance, I found out that I believe Shakespeare to be greater than Mozart. Lucky for Bill, I didn't put him up against Britney!
