<a href="http://www.knowledgeproblem.com/archives/001099.html">Lynne Kiesling dismantles</a> Christina Rosen's <a href="http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/7/rosen.htm"><em>Republic.com</em> qualms </a>about "egocasting." Check it out.

The issue of informational fragmentation and social coherence is an issue I'm putting on the "to do" list. Hmm, I guess I really should have a bigthink "to do" list. No doubt it is too much, and too hard, for me to do. So think of it as a bigthink assignment desk. If you're game, go for it!

<ul>
<li>Rebut: unrestricted liberty to choose the content of one's entertainment, news, art, children's education, etc., threatens the existence of a common culture, which is necessary to maintain a viable liberal social order.

<li>Understand: how institutional change alters behavior by changing preferences and belief systems, and not simply by changing relative prices (i.e., get a grip on likely processes of endogenous preference change), and how to apply this rigorously and in a non-<em>ad hoc</em> way to policy analysis without the ability to resort to traditional notions of efficiency.

<li>Defend: Behavioral economics does not provide an argument for regulation or paternalism, unless we think of regulation and paternalism as the implementation of market institutions that economize on (neo-classical) "rationality."

<li> Clarify: the difference between "social engineering" in the rationalistic or constructivistic sense, and institutional design in the Madisonian/Buchanan sense; how dynamic renegotiation of constitutional contract/institutional structure politically resembles "regulation," but how, once in place, changes are robustly self-regulating, "ecologically rational."

<li> Illuminate: how it is possible to distinguish between norms or social practices that have an adaptive function in preserving the main properties of a desirable social order and mere self-reinforcing equilibria, which may be opressive or illiberal, <em>without resorting to rationalist/constructivist fallacies</em>. The possibility of being a principled selective or progressive conservative; i.e., the inherent interdepedence of conservatism (rightly understood) and liberalism (rightly understood).

<li> Investigate: what, if any, are the policy implications of  "happiness research"? What, if any, are the implications for implicitly or explicitly hedonist or eudaimonist theories of efficiency, or of the good?
</ul>

Oh, and there's more. I'm just not thinking of it right now. Did you <em>not</em> drop out of grad school? Well, you know where to come for dissertation topics!
