Michael Lind writes:
<blockquote>Millions of Americans who by objective standards belong to the working class or lower middle class have persuaded themselves that they are part of the professional-investor elite, because they have worthless degrees from diploma mills, negligible amounts invested in stocks, and suburban trophy houses they cannot afford. For the college graduates at Starbucks working to pay off student loans for degrees that they will never use, as for the millions of Americans who are now "underwater," owing more on their mortgages than their houses are worth, the American dream has turned into a nightmare.</blockquote>
First, the phrase "the American dream has turned into a nightmare" should never be uttered publicly by someone who is, by objective standards, part of the intellectual class.

Anyway, what does "who by objective standards belong to the working class or lower middle class" mean? Â The usual social-scientific measure of class is income level. "Working class" doesn't really mean anything, since many of the forms of skilled labor that are thought of as "working class" pay solidly upper-middle wages. Is Lind saying that there are millions of Americans with incomes in the first and second quintile who think they are in the fourth? These same millions of Americans have worthless degrees from "diploma mills?" Maybe it comes to "millions," but the percentage of Americans in the bottom quintile with any kind of college degree is surpassingly small. Does he mean the University of Phoenix and DeVry--that sort of thing? I suspect many, perhaps even most, "diploma mill" degrees are worth <em>something. </em>What is a "college degree that they will never use"? Typically, college degrees are used as credentials qualifying those who hold them for a certain class of jobs. Is Lind's saying that a large percentage of college grads earn no more with a degree than they would without? Maybe! So how many?

Alas, an argument like this is too impressionistic to evaluate. If Lind contends that there are millions of Americans of all classes whose economically remunerative skills are not remunerative enough to justify buying such large houses, then he is surely correct. Lind goes on to argue that the objectively working- and lower-middle class ought to be discouraged from saving their money in the form most likely to get them a good rate of return. That's clear enough, but doesn't seem worth evaluating.
