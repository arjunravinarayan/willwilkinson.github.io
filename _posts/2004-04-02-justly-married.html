-- Being a moral person, a good person, is not about having an ideology, or the ability to deploy arguments in justification of what one has done, or what one believes. It is to a large extent about feeling the right thing at the right time. Look at <a href="http://ephemera.org/justly/">these pictures</a> of couples recently married in San Francisco. Look at the love and the joy in these people's faces. Now try to tell me--try to tell yourself--that this is wrong, that these people are wrong. If you can do it, then there's just something wrong with you: you're morally broken.
