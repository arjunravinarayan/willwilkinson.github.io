<p>An important <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2006/03/29/not-as-silly-as-she-sounds/">observation from Chris Bertram</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The fact is, of course, that far from being advocates of the kind of cosmopolitan universalism championed by Kant, most of the “decent” left are actually advocates of or apologists for some form of 19th-century ethnic nationalism. Of course, the case for and against such nationalism has to be argued on its merits, but there is something radically inconsistent in simultaneously banging on about the Enlightement and endorsing nationalisms antithetical to the ideals of thinkers like Kant and Voltaire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long live Kant and Voltaire!</p>
