<a href="http://www.economist.com/daily/chartgallery/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13244826&amp;fsrc=twitter">From the Economist</a>: Danes have greatest freedom of movement, able to cross the border of 157 countries and territories without a visa. Americans have it pretty good in this department, but it would be nice to be as free as a Dane. Is that so much to ask?Â
