Posts and discussion threads like <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2008/05/07/a-vicious-little-merchant-banker/">this one at Crooked Timber</a> are both depressing and funny. It's sad to see people scramble to apologize for others' complicity in one of the great moral crimes of human history in order to salvage their own reputations -- to avoid seeming morally discredited themselves for similarly shameful allegiances. But <a href="http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2008/05/the-appalling-o.html">the ad hominem vitriol</a> released for this purpose is a good laugh, in a pathetic human comedy sort of way.
