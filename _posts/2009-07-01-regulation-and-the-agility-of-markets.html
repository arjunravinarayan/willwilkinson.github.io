Last week Julian Sanchez made several interesting observations about estimating the costs of regulation. If markets are are innovative, dynamic, and tend swiftly adapt to new circumstances, then it seems that certain kinds of regulation won't damage efficiency all that much. However, if regulation hobbles the means by which markets adapt (e.g., the function of the price system), then the cost may be higher than estimated by conventional models. Or, as Julian puts it:
<blockquote>If the case for markets consists in their generally being smarter than we are, we should infer that, in most cases, narrow regulations will end up being less burdensome than one would expect, because the market will adapt in ways that can’t be predicted in advance. Regulations that target the adaptive mechanisms will be costlier than they seem, because the loss is in the form of adjustments or innovations that don’t happen.</blockquote>
I think this is a good insight, but I think it also leaves out something very important, which my inner Douglass North and James Buchanan insists on pointing out.

Market institutions always have some structure--which includes definitions of various kinds of property rights--and that structure is always, at some level, a direct or indirect effect of politics (broadly construed). There is no already-constituted prepolitical market "out there" upon which lawmakers and regulators subsequently impose their will. The structure of the market as we find it is always the outcome of prior political conflicts, impositions, settlements, negotiations, compromises, etc. Because market structure has distributive consequences, there is always demand for the "regulation" or "deregulation" of markets in ways that will improve some individuals' and groups' interests relative to others. (Think of the fight over patents and copyrights, for example. Disney has a strong interest in opposing "deregulation" of the uses of it's current properties.)

Sometimes it is simpler to think not in terms of regulation and deregulation, but simply in terms of conflict--usually distributive, but sometimes purely ideological--over the use of government to modify the status quo market structure. So there is a game defined by the rules of the market. And then there is a higher-order game, the stakes of which are the rules of the market. This conflict is either regulated by a yet-higher-order set of rules or it isn't. Names for this are "constitutionally limited government" and "the rule of law." Without these rules for governing the political (i.e., distributive/ideological) contest to rig the structure of markets, complex markets tend not to work very well at all.

Regulations that interfere with the mechanisms that allow the market to adapt to new exigencies are especially pernicious. But even relatively benign regulation that come to pass outside of the meta-regulatory scheme can be
