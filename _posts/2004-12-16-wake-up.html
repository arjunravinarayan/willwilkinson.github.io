I find that I am unreasonably obsessed with "Wake Up" from the Arcade Fire's <em>Funeral</em>. It's just so <em>dramatic!</em> You can hear a <a href="http://www.mergerecords.com/media.php?query_band_id=98">stream</a> at the Merge Records site.

(Remember, I said "unreasonably," although Pitchfork gave the album a 9.7, so maybe it's not just me, although I think the PF review is <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/a/arcade-fire/funeral.shtml">extraordinarily over-earnest</a>.)
