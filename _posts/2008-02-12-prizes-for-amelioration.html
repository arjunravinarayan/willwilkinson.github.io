Has anyone seen an extended argument for doing nothing at all about global warming other than offering huge prizes for technological fixes?

<strong>Update:</strong>

Also... <a href="http://www.coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2008/01/the-critical-fl.html">from Warren Meyer</a> I see this: "[Some climate scientists] claim now that man-made sulfate aerosols and black carbon are cooling the earth, and when some day these pollutants are reduced, we will see huge catch-up warming."

Has anyone in the Pigou Club advanced the argument for subsidizing sulfate aerosols and black carbon (and whatever else has cooling effects)?

I'm sincerely asking. Such subsidies are only logical, right?
