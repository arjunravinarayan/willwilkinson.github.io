I've posted a reply to <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2007/10/who_cares_why.php">Yglesia's inequality post</a> over <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2007/10/12/why-the-mechanisms-of-inequality-matter/">at Cato@Liberty</a>. Also, FYI, this <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/10/explanations_matter.cfm">very smart Free Exchange post</a> on exactly the same thing is by my sage colleague, not me.
