-- Well, very suddenly, I am teaching an introductory aesthetics course at <a href="http://www.howard.edu">Howard University</a>, not far from my digs. I'm scrambling to prepare.

In addition, I'm guest blogging over at<a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/4.html"> Liberty & Power</a>. And I'm still blogging at <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/">Radley's</a> until, I guess, he tells me I'm not.
