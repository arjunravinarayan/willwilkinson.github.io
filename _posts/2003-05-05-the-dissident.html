-- Check out the g<a href="http://www.the-dissident.com/"></a>reat new campus publication produced by the Critical Review Foundation. 50,000 copies of the first issue has gone out to fancy schools, in an attempt to reach out to bright undergrads who rarely have a chance to hear ideas that fall anywhere outside of the center-left to radical-left range that dominates in the universities. The Dissident is the smartest campus think mag I've ever seen. Indeed, it's smarter than lots of think mags for adults. And I'm not saying that just because of <a href="http://www.the-dissident.com/globalization.shtml">my piece</a> trashing the World Bank and the IMF is in it. Jeff Friedman's <a href="http://www.the-dissident.com/theory.shtml">long piece</a> is a great summary of his extremely provocative post-post libertarianism, and a good taste of what one gets at the Critical Review seminar (highly recommended for undergrads in poltical theory and thinky journalism.)
