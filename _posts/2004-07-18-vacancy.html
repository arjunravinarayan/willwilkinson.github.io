<img src="http://our-dc.com/images/our-house/house.jpg" class="floatimgleft"/>If you, or someone you know, is looking for a place to live in Washington, DC starting in September, there is a yet-unfilled vacancy at the Westminnie House. 934 Westminster is ONE (convoluted) block's distance from the U St/Cardozo/African American Civil War Memorial metro stop. We're within a leisurely five minute stroll of some of DC's best music venues: 9:30, Black Cat, Velvet Lounge, DC9, Bohemian Caverns, and more. The restaurants and bars of a rapidly gentrifying U St are RIGHT THERE. Walk to DuPont: 15 minutes. Walk to Adams Morgan: 15 minutes. Walk Downtown: 15-20 minutes. Giant (ugh) and Whole Foods supermarkets are nearby.

Preferred roomates are 20-to-early-30-something young professional intellectual types (e.g., lettered in debate or quiz bowl). Your roommates would include two researchers at the Urban Institute and a UMD philosophy grad student.

Query in the comments, or to flybottle [[at]] willwilkinson [[dot]] net.

[Update: The vacancy has been filled. Thanks for your interest.]
