This Australian couple <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7334649.stm">is keeping it all in the family</a>:
<blockquote>John Deaves, 61, appeared on the TV show 60 Minutes with daughter Jenny, 39, and nine-month-old Celeste - to whom he is both father and grandfather.

Last month a judge banned them from having sex with each other and revealed they had a child in 2001 who died.

But they insisted on the programme that they were "normal intellectual adults". <!-- E SF -->

[...]

Mr Deaves had left the family home when his daughter Jenny was a baby, and did not see her again for 30 years.

When the couple met, in 2000, they began a sexual relationship.

[...]

"John and I are in this relationship as consenting adults. We are just asking for a little bit of respect and understanding."

The couple each pleaded guilty to two charges of incest last month and were banned from having sex with each other.

According to the judge's ruling in the case, the couple had a child in 2001 who died from congenital heart disease shortly after birth.</blockquote>
So who wants to step up and justify the ban on these two making sweet love? If anyone thinks the state actually has a legitimate interest in preventing genetic defects, should it be more active in banning other potentially dangerous copulations?
