-- Hi everybody! I'm back from Charlottesville. The Social Change Workshop was I think a big success. Great students. Great faculty. Great week. So many people I want to keep in touch with. And the Mercatus  <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/socialchange/article.php/786.html">manuscript discussion</a> of John Nye's forthcoming this past weekend was outstanding. Chilled by the pool and played tennis with <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/people.php/2.html?menuid=1">Brian</a>, Frederic Sautet (who should have a Mercatus bio page by now... cough) and <a href="http://mscourt.blogspot.com/">Courtney</a>. It was fun to hear about the Copenhagen Consensus from Doug North. And I had an especially nice conversation with Barry Weingast Saturday night about endogenous preferences.
