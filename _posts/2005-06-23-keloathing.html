Julian has <a href="http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/2005/06/whats_yours_is.shtml#009953">nailed</a> the upshot of Kelo:

<blockquote>Now that the "liberal" justices on the court have sided with the drug warriors against cancer patients, and with a plan to rob people of their homes for the benefit of wealthy developers, will some court-watchers on the left begin to question the wisdom of having let economic freedom become the red-headed stepchild of modern jurisprudence?</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . The straightforward implication is that any taking of a private residence to hand it over to a business, or just from a poor person to a wealthy person, will be a taking in service of a public purpose: As a general rule, the rich pay more taxes than the poor, and businesses pay more taxes than households.</blockquote>

That is, if you have something somebody richer than you wants, watch out. Good work, egalitarians, good work.

Don Boudreaux has <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2005/06/hosannas_to_the.html">a strong reaction</a>, too.
