I have a pet game-theoretical theory about the source of what I call "the communitarian craving." This is a half-baked sketch.

The theory is based in the idea that the function of intrapersonal psychological unity is to solve interpersonal coordination games. I can assure a potential partner in cooperation that I will uphold my agreements only if I can signal "integrity". I can signal integrity--an unwavering commitment to intrapersonal consistency over time--only if I actually have it. And I have it only if I believe, if I feel, that I will suffer tremendously if I simply disavow previous commitments. (What would it be like to sincerely believe this: "Sure I said I'd do that, but so what? I was really a whole different person back then, and no one can make promises that bind somebody else." It would be lonely.)

But in order to really facilitate coordination, integrity needs a common sense of how things should be done. If we are doggedly consistent about doing things <em>our own way</em>, we may be able to trust that the other will do things her way, but we may never successfully settle on terms of cooperation, and so never realize gains from trade. So a successful signal of pro-cooperative integrity requires the internalization of a culture that contains all sorts of otherwise counterproductive costly rituals and norms.  (It needs to be costly in order to weed out fakers who will rip you off if you come to trust them.) Winning the cooperative benefits from being a good X, where X is a member of the tribe or community, requires a kind of meta-commitment to the norms of the X-community that allow us all to maintain a sufficiently high level of cooperation-enabling trust. The idea of disavowing one's X-ness needs to feel like a kind of terrifying self-inflicted violence. <em>Who would I be</em> if I didn't observe this idiotic ritual? Didn't observe this rule?

The horror of disintegration enables gains from trade in small, bounded communities. But it also traps us in very "thick" communitarian identities. Now, the transition from personal to impersonal exchange, especially including the development of impersonal devices for enabling reputation and trust, has made the game theoretic need for thick identity--for intrapersonal continuity build around an elaborate scheme of shared commitments and practices--more or less obsolete. And this has made "individualism" -- a culture of elective and customized identity -- culturally possible. This has been immensely liberating and has unleashed massive welfare-enhancing creativity and potential.

Nevertheless, we retain a deep taste for "thickness," much like our taste for fats and sugars. Thick community is psychologically <em>delicious</em>, and we need at least a bit of it in order to feel well. But the intense craving for all-consuming thick, solidaristic communities is, at this point in history, atavistic, maladaptive, dangerous. It simply isn't true that we will disintegrate if we turn our backs on the moral and religious communities in which we are raised. Indeed, we very often benefit hugely from striking out and leaving it behind. Lots of people are made almost crazy by this fact of the modern world -- that you can turn on a dime, disown the imagined core of your life's meaning,  and not disappear. Some people (I'm talking to you Osama bin Laden) will do anything to avoid admitting it. But most of us are not mad with lust for totalizing thick identities. For most of us, the dissatisfaction with "thin" identities in pluralistic commercial societies is rather like being on a low-sugar, low-fat diet. It's <em>good </em>for us, but we don't necessarily <em>like</em> it. The solution is, basically, better recipes. Up to now, objective change in pluralistic commercial societies has outpaced the advent of new cultural forms, new recipes, that use the not-so-communitarian ingredients at hand to create lives that are not only objectively better-flourishing, but also more fully satisfying.
