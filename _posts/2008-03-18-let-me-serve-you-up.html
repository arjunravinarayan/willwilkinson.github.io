"<a href="http://www.myspace.com/raheemdevaughn">Customer</a>" by Raheem DeVaughn may be the greatest song ever written as it is the first to <em>fully</em> grasp, and to deploy for the purposes of seduction, the immense romance of being catered to ... like a <em>customer </em>(at an idealized, perfected, phantasmagorical Burger King, one is lead to imagine). The luxury of the commercial relationship lies in the simplicity of its mode of reciprocity. "You can have it your way; you're the customer," DeVaughn croons. Which is to say, commercial exchange allows for customization and undivided satiation, as it requires but a simple payment and not constant emotional negotiation and renegotiation to arrive at an only partially satisfying compromise.  To be treated like a "customer" is to be treated precisely the way <em>you</em> want, not the way someone else wants to treat you.  Though the "payment" implied in the song is nothing more or less than acquiescence to DeVaughns' attentive, indulgent , and no doubt skillful ministrations, "Customer" works astonishingly well as an anthem for the legalization of sexual services.
