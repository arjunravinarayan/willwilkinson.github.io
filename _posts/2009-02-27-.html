In <a href="http://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1259717203">a recent tweet</a>, Matt Yglesias said, "Love the irony of right-wing think tankers railing against the unproductive nature of work done by public employees." But what's the irony?  That "right-wing think tankers" are, like public employees, unproductive?<em> </em>Is that <em>ironic</em>? Would it be ironic for a short person to point out that, say, pygmies are short? ("Ha! But you're short too!") If the thought is that the work done by government employees is in fact very productive, contrary to the claims of unproductive "right-wing think tankers," then one would find the claim false, not ironic. ("Actually, short person, pygmies are average sized.") So, Matt may or may not agree with "right-wing think tankers" about the productivity of government workers, but doesn't think that people who are paid by private individuals and foundations to make this kind of statement is itself part of a productive occupation? I don't know.
