<a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=02&amp;year=2009&amp;base_name=end_the_mortgage_deduction">I agree with Ezra Klein</a> in agreeing with Ed Glaeser. Here's something, like trashing ag subsidies, you can get a lot of libertarians and liberals to agree on. It can be a bit disheartening to see just how little this kind of agreement amounts to when compared to the incentives of the politicans. (Iowa's extremely powerful Senators will die in the last ditch for our subsidies.) But I think this kind of wonk consensus building really matters over the medium-term. Democracy is not a mechanical <em>cui bono</em> machine and elite opinion can, when not coopted by the incentives of the parties, work as a countervailing force.
