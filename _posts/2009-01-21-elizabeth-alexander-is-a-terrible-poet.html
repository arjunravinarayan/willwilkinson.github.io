We all have off days. Not every poem is a good one. So was that a terrible poem or is Elizabeth Alexander a terrible poet? Well, I just spend a whole three minutes <a href="http://www.elizabethalexander.net/poems.html">on her web page</a> and I can say with complete certainty that she is a terrible poet. She is to poetry approximately what Rick Warren is to theology. So... Why?!!! Politics has its reasons.

But don't take my word for it. Have you read "Neonatology," by Elizabeth Alexander? Here is the beginning, offered for your personal evaluation.

funky, is
leaky, is
a soggy, bloody crotch, is
sharp jets of breast milk shot straight across the room,
is gaudy, mustard-colored poop, is
postpartum tears that soak the baby’s lovely head.</span>

In my opinion, that's the best part.
