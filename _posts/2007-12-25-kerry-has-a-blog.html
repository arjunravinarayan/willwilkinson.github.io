Having heard that in 2008 online journaling is going to be the next big thing, early adopter extraordinaire Kerry Howley has <a href="http://kerryhowley.com/">launched her very own "weblog"</a>. Check it out guys! If you have your own "blog" add her to your "blogroll"! Or <a href="http://kerryhowley.com/feed/">subscribe to her "feed."</a>

I know this is what I wanted for Christmas. Have a merry one!
