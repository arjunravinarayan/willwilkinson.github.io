Jacob Levy <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2005/02/whats_hayek_got.html#c3704339">has been sighted</a> in Yglesias's comments making helpful clarificatory points about Rawls and Hayek.

Regarding the Rawls luck argument, of which Matt remains unwisely enamored, may I suggest my <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/081104F.html">August TCS essay</a>, which also gives substance to Jacob's point that the luck argument proves too much?
