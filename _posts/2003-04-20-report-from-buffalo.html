-- So, last weekend I was in Buffalo for a grad conference on <a href="http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/">John Searle</a> and a <a href="http://www.geog.buffalo.edu/ncgia/workshop/">bigger conference </a>on issues surrounding the works of Searle and Peruvian economist Hernando DeSoto. I presented a paper at the little Searle conference, and the man himself was there to comment. Searle has always been one of my philosophical heroes, so it was pretty thrilling to have him comment on a bit of my work. He liked it! Searle's a remarkably funny and affable guy, and, besides being just astoundingly smart, probably has the keenest bullshit detector on Earth.

Anyway, if you like to read things with titles like "Rationality, Institutional Ontology, and Contractarian Choice," drop me a line and I'll send you my paper.
