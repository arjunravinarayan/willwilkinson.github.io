<p>In <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/8545">this week's episode of Free Will</a> over at Bloggingheads TV, <em>Reason </em>chief Matt Welch and I discuss his rollicking, revealing book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0230603963?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0230603963&amp;adid=0EG62Z78XGFF1W9EYR4D&amp;">McCain: The Myth of a Maverick</a>, </em>and the real man behind the myth. Sadly McCain's looking like a GOP lock coming into Super Tuesday, and he polls strong nationally against both Clinton and Obama. The man could well become our next president, to the joy of arms manufacturers and the dismay of those of us who do not think a life not devoted to the service of the American state is devoid of purpose. Is that a triple negative? I guess that&nbsp; goes to show how sour I am on John Sidney McCain III!&nbsp; </p><iframe style="width: 120px; height: 240px" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=theflybottle-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0230603963&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
