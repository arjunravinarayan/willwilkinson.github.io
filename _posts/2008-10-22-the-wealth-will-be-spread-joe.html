My commentary on this morning's Marketplace <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/10/22/wilkinson/">reminds America's most loved and hated non-licensed plumber of an ugly truth</a>: democratic politics just is a wealth-spreading excercise, and there's no avoiding it. If you're gonna pick sides, you're just picking your favorite redistributive poision.
