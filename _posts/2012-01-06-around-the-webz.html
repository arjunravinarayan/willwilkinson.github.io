My holiday blogging hiatus is over!

At Democracy in America: Evidence from Iowa that <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/01/tea-party-movement">limited government isn't really a priority for tea-party Republicans</a>.

At Big Think: A free-associative mini-essay <a href="http://bigthink.com/ideas/41828">against resolutions and the tyranny of the annual</a>.

And, from last week, my Bleeding Hearts Libertarians guest post on "<a href="http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/01/why-im-not-a-bleeding-heart-libertarian/">Why I'm Not a Bleeding-Heart Libertarian</a>." Two of my Economist colleagues comment on aspects of this post, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2012/01/libertarians">here</a> and <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2012/01/lexical-accuracy">here</a>.
