Here's what I can give you so far. I'll give you the breakdowns of answers by ideological identification in the next post. Let me emphatically state that the presence of pie charts in no way suggests the presence of science. The poll sample is representative of nothing other than the set of people who either read this blog and are willing to take unscientific polls or who follow me, or certain other people who follow me, on Twitter and like to take unscientific polls. That said, I think the result are suggestive, and fun to talk about. I'm personally most interested in the ideological breakdown of poll participants, which gives me a rough sense of my readership. I will show you later what "Other" included, since it's sort of funny.
