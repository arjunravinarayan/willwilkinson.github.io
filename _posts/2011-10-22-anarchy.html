I haven't done this in while... Gene Callahan writes:
I see the anarchist/statist distinction as the most fundamental political divide. Once one accepts the notion that initiating aggression is OK under some circumstances, then the case for human liberty has been abandoned, and all that remains is to argue over what degree of enslavement is acceptable. Having ventured down that road, minarchist libertarians should not be surprised at the difficulties they encounter in resisting the expansion of their night-watchman state.
This sort of thing is casts a lot more shadow than light. Maybe Gene should observe that he often finds himself at gatherings with minarchists, assume there is some reason they have all showed up at the same shindig, and conclude that the most fundamental political divide is between those who care about liberty and those who don't. Maybe. The second sentence is patently false. I'm a counterexample! I think initiating aggression is OK in a good number of circumstances. Yet I am keenly interested in building the case for human liberty. Am I in the grip of some kind of massive confusion? (The Founders of the American republic would no doubt have been perplexed that they had abandoned the case for human liberty!) I think may I like to resist simplistic, deracinated abstract theories about the boundaries of rights? Maybe I don't think utopian ideal theory makes people's lives better, or is likely to make them more free.
This kind of issue turns on lots of philosophical fundamentals. For instance, I think a kind of positive liberty--the actual positive possibility, ability, or capacity to do things--dominates negative liberty--absence of coerced restriction on doing things--though I think that a very broad sphere of negative liberty, properly structured, is a major necessary cause of  positive liberty. I would rather live in Sweden now than in the US in 1890, because I would be more free in the morally relevant sense in Sweden now, though I would be more coerced. Sweden, however, would have more freedom in the morally relevant sense if it was less coercive.
The fact that initiatory coercion is not equivalent to "enslavement," except according to a badly grounded philosophical theory that almost  no one has reason to accept, would seems to be a problem for Gene's argument. Also, even if coercion is enslavement, and we think some is OK, and so "all that remains is to argue over what degree of enslavement is acceptable," it might be the case that there is a very good argument that only a very very small amount of "enslavement" is acceptable, that there is a bright line between not enough and too much, and that therefore we can take a firm stand against those who want too much. Gene's argument sounds to my ear rather like one that maintains that unless you are not fully committed to abstinence education, then you shouldn't be surprised when you discover your daughter experimenting with a german shepherd.
Deeper still is the question of why exactly initiatory coercion is the basis of the relevant distinction. I think the fundamental distinction is between mutually beneficial coordination or the lack thereof. Suppose there are two societies, A and B. Society A has developed a culture that embodies certain norms which make it possible for its members to create complex cooperative relationships without the need for a monopoly provider of coercive third party enforcement of agreements. Well, that's just fantastic! Huzzah society A! That's the cheapest and best kind of coordination! Suppose B, due to reasons of history and culture, is simply unable to get a system of competitive contract enforcement agencies off the ground, and everyone would be rather better off with a monopoly provider. Sure the monopoly provider will eat into the cooperative surplus. But the surplus will be bigger after than the monopoly takes its cut than it would be without the monopoly. So B ought to have a monopoly provider! Clearly! Are we really supposed to believe that they ought to wait around, suffering from lost cooperative opportunities until their culture finally changes enough (if it ever does) to be able to coordinate at a high level of complexity and profit without a monopoly contract enforcer?
You know, I don't like the Westphalian nation-state. I'd like more creative thinking about polycentric order, overlapping jurisdictions, distributed jurisdictions, etc. But I don't have a problem with the idea of legitimate initiatory coercion. I have a problem with leaving liberty-enhancing gains from cooperation on the table.
Last, is the enthymeme in Gene's argument that if the minarchists were anarachists, they wouldn't encounter so many difficulties in resisting the growth of the state? That the state wouldn't have grown as much? Really? Because of what? The rousing moral clarity of a theory  almost no one accepts?
Violence directed at another, you hold, is only just in self-defense, and then only to the extent necessary to thwart one’s assailant
