Here's the info:
<blockquote><span><strong>"Naomi Klein: A Prebuttal" </strong></span>

<span><strong>Speaker: <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/">Will Wilkinson</a>
</strong></span>

<span><strong></strong><strong><span>Tuesday, February 17th</span></strong></span><span><strong></strong><strong>
</strong></span>

<span><strong>7 pm, 1505 Seamans Center</strong></span>

Co-sponsored by Advocates of Liberty and U of I Department of Economics

Naomi Klein will be on campus giving a UI Lecture Committee speech in February where she will be talking about her book "Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism".  This book attempts to tie Bush's corporatist big-business economic policies, the Iraq War, and most other bad things to the free market ideas of Milton Friedman. Will Wilkinson will defend "neo-liberal" free markets, defend Friedman against Klein's scurrilous attacks, and reveal the many errors, factual and logical, in Klein's bestseller.

In a lecture one night before Naomi Klein's appearance on campus, Wilkinson will give a talk co-sponsored by the Advocates of Liberty and the UI Department of Economics.  Let the fun begin.</blockquote>
