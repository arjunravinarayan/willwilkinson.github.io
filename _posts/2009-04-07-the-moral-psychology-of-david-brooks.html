<p>David Brooks’ <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/opinion/07Brooks.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion">column on neo-sentimentalist moral psychology</a> is as exasperating as most of his columns drawing on science. They usually go like this: </p>  <blockquote>   <p>Scientists have discovered X. Mostly X vanquishes my intellectual bugbears and confirms me in my prejudices. To the extent it doesn’t, science isn’t really an authoritative source of wisdom, now is it?</p> </blockquote>  <p>Here’s this week’s variation:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>The rise and now dominance of this emotional approach to morality is an epochal change. It challenges all sorts of traditions. It challenges the bookish way philosophy is conceived by most people. It challenges the Talmudic tradition, with its hyper-rational scrutiny of texts. It challenges the new atheists, who see themselves involved in a war of reason against faith and who have an unwarranted faith in the power of pure reason and in the purity of their own reasoning.</p>    <p>Finally, it should also challenge the very scientists who study morality. They’re good at explaining how people make judgments about harm and fairness, but they still struggle to explain the feelings of awe, transcendence, patriotism, joy and self-sacrifice, which are not ancillary to most people’s moral experiences, but central. The evolutionary approach also leads many scientists to neglect the concept of individual responsibility and makes it hard for them to appreciate that most people struggle toward goodness, not as a means, but as an end in itself.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Let’s look more closely at a couple of these claims. </p>  <ul>   <li>The rise of &quot;the emotional approach to morality” … “challenges the new atheists.”</li> </ul>  <p>What? Pure silliness. There is nothing whatsoever about the new sentimentalism in moral psychology that begins to imply a vindication of faith relative to reason. This is scientific work that uses the rationalist methods of science to understand the centrality of sentiment in humans. It takes the power of reason for granted, and if it is successful work, then it validates the power of reason. </p>  <p>If, say, Haidt is right that most moral judgments are <em>ex post</em> rationalizations of prior emotional responses, then he has not shown that <em>all </em>judgments are <em>ex post</em> rationalizations of prior emotional responses. For example, scientific judgments aren’t like that, or else he wouldn’t have <em>discovered</em> this about moral judgment, he’d just be <em>asserting </em>it. It’s not like Haidt, in showing just how deeply feeling-laden our moral judgments are, has also shown that everything, including the techniques of scientific rationality, is an expression of prejudice. By providing yet another well-grounded scientific explanation, he has demonstrated once again that techniques of scientific rationality are successfully explanatory. In this case, a successful explanation of human moral judgment shows just how prone we are to argue reflexively on behalf of our enculturated moral intuitions. This should <em>decrease</em> our confidences in our intuitions relative to scientific rationality. There is no reason whatsoever to think this will make faith look rosier. </p>  <p>Now, if we think that the lesson here is that most people, who aren’t scientists, don’t change their minds due to good arguments, but because of some kind of socialization or cultural pressure, then it seems to me that the efforts of the “new atheists” have been shown to be all the more necessary. The norms of reason are not native. They are fragile cultural achievements, which makes them all the more precious, and all the more important to vigorously promote. It seems we <em>ought </em>to create social pressure to adopt and respect them, as the “new atheists” do, if we wish to continue to reap the enormous blessings of applied rationality. Brooks is right to see the “new atheists” as apostles of&#160; reason, but their “faith” in it isn’t “unwarranted.” As Brooks seems to recognize when it is convenient for him, science -- the institutions of applied reason -- works.</p>  <ul>   <li>The rise of “the emotional approach to morality” … “should also challenge the very scientists who study morality. They’re good at explaining how people make judgments about harm and fairness, but they still struggle to explain the feelings of awe, transcendence, patriotism, joy and self-sacrifice, which are not ancillary to most people’s moral experiences, but central.”</li> </ul>  <p>First, everything I just said. Second, they just <em>got </em>good at explaining judgments about harm and fairness, so why not expect them to get good at this other stuff? Everything Brooks has said up to this point assumes that the science is good, so one would expect that. But this is where Brooks kicks up a cloud of mystery to leave space for his own prejudices after he has finished using a bit of science to serve his ideological purposes. It’s a good trick: Grant science just enough authority to make it say what you need it to, and then throw that authority into doubt, lest someone else come along and try to make it say something else. Third, I don’t think Brooks has been paying attention even to the people he cites, such as Haidt, who has gone a good way in explaining the religious emotions, the emotions of in-group solidarity (i.e., patriotism) and more. </p>
