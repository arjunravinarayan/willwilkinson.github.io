<b><a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/">Andrew Sullivan</a> won't rest until the last liberal is smoked out of its cave!</b> Geesh, was he beaten as a child by hippies? Sullivan near enough gets an intellectual hernia straining to map Johnny Walker/Mike Spann onto the dubious Blue/Red electoral division. It's really just dumb. Where was Timothy McVeigh from again?

(Upstate New York, it turns out.. But you know what I'm getting at.)
