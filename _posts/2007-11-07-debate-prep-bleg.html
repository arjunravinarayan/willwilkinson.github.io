<p>I'm busy prepping for Saturday's <a href="http://www.economist.com/nydebates/">happiness debate in New York</a>. I haven't been fastidiously following the happiness literature since I published my Cato paper. So if there is some interesting new work I ought to be aware of, please let me know. Also, if you are aware of anything Sachs has done touching on happiness research (all I can find is a Brookings panel he was once on), please give a shout out. I can't wait.  This is going to be a blast. </p>
