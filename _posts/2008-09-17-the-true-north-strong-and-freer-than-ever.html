Check it out patriots. According to the newly-minted <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/efw/">Cato/Fraser Economic Freedom of the World Report</a>, the frosty land of toques and chesterfields has leap-frogged the U.S. to take 7th place, completely humiliating the tied-for-8th place land of the ever-less-free, home of the brave.

Is it now possible to even half-credibly make the case that the United States, in the age of warrantless wiretaps and the shoeless airport security line, is a freer country than Canadia? I doubt it. Read it and weep, fair weather laissez faire yanks:

O' Canada! Why are you so cold?
