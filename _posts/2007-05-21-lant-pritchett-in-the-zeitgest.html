Kerry has been raving for months about the work of economist Lant Pritchett, in particular his book <a href="http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/10174/">Let Their People Come</a>, and has been planning a story based on his ideas about labor mobility. Last night she showed me one of his papers, "Boom Towns and Ghost Countries" [doc], which inspired a number of new thoughts that I will share below. Then, this morning, Dani Rodrik  <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2007/05/more_on_immigra.html">mentioned Pritchett today</a>, and noted that the Times Magazine is profiling him. Seems his time has come.

The reason Pritchett rocks my world is that he challenges the reification of the nation-state that plagues both contemporary political theory and contemporary social science. What does the world look like if you remove political restrictions on the movement of people? In his Boom Towns paper, Pritchett notes that without restrictions on the liberty of movement, some countries would basically empty out -- become "ghost countries" -- but the restrictions keep people in, turning those places into into "zombie countries."  But how can this <em>possibly </em>be justified? Here is his conclusion: 
<blockquote>Without population mobility geographic specific shocks create a different dynamic—one of falling wages and outputs. If labor supply cannot be elastic then prices must adjust, not quantities. The consequence is that it is plausible that even in a fully “globalized” world and even with the best possible “policies and institutions” some countries will not succeed—they are potentially ghost countries but are forced by restrictions on population mobility into an existence as zombies.

Why do I wish to stress this inconvenient fact and the uncomfortable idea that Zambia might be a zombie? Precisely because all current policy discussions focus only on Zambia—the nation-state--and not on Zambi<em>ans</em> the people. International organizations and international negotiations and international forums tend to be exactly that—inter<em>national</em> where the actors and agents all represent nation-states and their interests. There are structured organizations and institutions for bringing about reductions in the barriers to the movement of goods, for the movement of finance. There are organizations to bring about <em>national</em> development. But almost certainly the easiest way to improve the living standards of a Zam<em>bian</em> is not to improve living standards in Zambia but to allow the person the choice to move out of Zambia. Perhaps bringing this opportunity about needs to come more strongly on the world’s policy agenda.

Finally, in some discussions of this paper people have suggested that it was “insensitive” to suggest even the possibility that all existing national boundaries do not encompass a viable economy capable of sustaining their current population at anything like a decent standard of living. But this “political correctness” critique of doubting national viability is misguided—as it mistakes “nations” for something real. Who created the borders? Who created the “nations”? I would argue in fact that this view has it exactly backwards and that to insist on the interests of nation-states to control their borders over all other considerations—including the well-being of human beings, who through no action or fault of their own are trapped in economically non-viable regions—is not a normatively attractive view.</blockquote>
"Not normatively attractive" must have required considerable constraint.  I think "morally criminal<em>"</em> is about right.

I found this incredibly clarifying, bracing, and stimulating all at once. And it suggests an argument that I don't believe I've seen. In political theory/philosophy there has been a long, almost completely retarded debate about "global justice," which is basically a debate over whether rich nation-states owe poor nation-states money as a matter of justice.
