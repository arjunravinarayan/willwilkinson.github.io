In the new issue of <em>The American</em>, Nobel Prize-winner Gary Becker and Clark Prize-winner Kevin Murphy <a href="http://american.com/archive/2007/may-june-magazine-contents/the-upside-of-income-inequality">diagnose rising income inequality</a>.
<blockquote>Why is the earnings gap widening? Because the demand for educated and other skilled persons is growing. That is hardly surprising, given developments in computers and the Internet, advances in biotechnology, and a general shift in economic activity to more edu­cation-intensive sectors, such as finance and professional services. Also, globalization has encouraged the import­ing of products using relatively low-skilled labor from abroad. At the same time, world demand has risen for the kinds of products and services that are provided by high-skilled employees.

[...]

This brings us to our punch line. Should an increase in earnings inequality due primarily to higher rates of return on education and other skills be considered a favorable rather than an unfavor­able development? We think so. Higher rates of return on capital are a sign of greater productivity in the economy, and that inference is fully applica­ble to human capital as well as to physical capital. The initial impact of higher returns to human cap­ital is wider inequality in earnings (the same as the initial effect of higher returns on physical capital), but that impact becomes more muted and may be reversed over time as young men and women invest more in their human capital.</blockquote>
As I argue incessantly, inequality per se is morally neutral. The mechanism that drive inequality are the proper subject of moral appraisal, and I agree with Becker and Murphy that higher returns to human capital, and the inequality it generates, is a positive development, since it creates an incentive for investment in skills. They wisely point out that in an economy where there is an economic premium to education and training, a more steeply progressive tax structure would, in effect, tax the acquisition of new skills. That might successfully reduce inequality, but not in a way that helps a single soul.  

Becker and Murphy go on to argue that "policymakers and the pub­lic should focus attention on how to raise the fraction of American youth who complete high school and then go on for a college education." I'm willing to buy it. But I know my friend Bryan Caplan, who is working on a book about why "<a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/03/page_one_of_my.html">there is too much education going on</a>," would disagree. Bryan argues that university diplomas mostly function to <em>signal </em>prior<em> </em>competence, and that time and money spent in school is largely wasted. If he's right, Becker and Murphy's emphasis may be misguided, and I suspect Bryan may in fact be right. In which case it strikes me that there is a huge entrepreneurial opportunity for whomever can come up with an alternative scheme of credible human capital certification.  Who cares if people develop their skills by attended classes at the local college, listening to <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Global/all-courses.htm">free lectures from MIT</a>, learning on the job, or by sitting in their mom's basement gaining mad hacking skilz? I don't. But employers do.   <em> </em>
