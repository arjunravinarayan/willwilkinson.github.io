This was recorded a while back, before I cut my hair and became a Canadian. I chat with University of Toronto philosopher Joeseph Heath about his new book (only in Canada!) <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Filthy-Lucre-Joseph-Heath/dp/1554683955/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1241207302&sr=8-1">Filthy Lucre: Economics for People Who Hate Capitalism</a></em>. Think of it as <em>Economics in One Lesson</em> for Naomi Klein fans. This is a good, really readable book. I think it helps a lot that he's not an economist. The section on right-wing fallacies is largely on the money and a great challenge for rote libertarians and conservatives. The section of left-wing fallacies is terrific, and it would be terrific if more folks on the left were anywhere near as economically literate as Heath.
