-- So, from Volokh, I see <a href="http://volokh.com/2004_03_21_volokh_archive.html#108025387171666521">this announcement </a>of the Law & Aesthetics fiction contest. For those skeptical about the intellectual laugh riot that is the <a href="http://www.theihs.org/workshop">Social Change Workshop</a>, I remember having a somewhat drunken conversation about just this idea with what must surely be one of the Boalt organizers. And now it's a reality! Don't you want to <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2004SCWInvitemail.html">come</a>?!

Notes for law and aesthetics....

- Significant formalism
- Could Baumgarten and Blackstone have met? Shared a mistress?
- The Bloomsbury judicial intuitionists
- Legal neutrality and disinterested contemplation
- Penumbras and emanations
- Weimar School of interpretive absurdism
- Cruel, unusual, and sublime punishment
