I want to share this passage lovely in both content and form from Louis Menand's essay "Laurie Anderson's <em>United States</em>" in his collection of essays <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/0374104344?v=glance"><em>American Studies</em></a>.

<blockquote>. . . most of the songs and stand-up routines Anderson delivered in <em>United States</em> were wan ironic tales about daily life in postindustrial--what we now call the digital--age, with repeated references to airplanes, televisions, petrochemicals, missiles, and outer space. The gadgets and the spaceships may have given people the idea that <em>United States</em> enacted a disaffection with creeping dehumanization, that it was a cri de coeur against the disenchantment But its effect on me was exactly the opposite. I took the point to be that the world <em>can't</em> be disenchanted, because enchantment is the mode in which human beings experience it. The trail of the human serpent (said William James) is over everything, even answering-machine beeps and aircraft safety instructions. Our electronics is no less an expression of ourselves than our poetry is.</blockquote>

I don't like Laurie Anderson, but I'm glad Menand does.
