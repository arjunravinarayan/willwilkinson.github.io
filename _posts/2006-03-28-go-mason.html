<p>Peter Boettke and Alex Tabarrok have <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2138846/">a cute piece in Slate</a> on the connection between underdog Mason economics and underdog Mason basketball. I'm glad they took the chance to grab some attention while the world is paying attention to good ol' GMU. </p>
<p>I still have a Mason email account from my days at IHS and Mercatus, and in many ways I consider myself something of a Mason product, even if I never once took a class there. The number of <em>seminars </em>I attended there, however, is . . . large. And it's hard to hang around Tyler, Pete, Don, Tullock (well, get mocked by Tullock), and Vernon Smith (and many more) without it permanently altering the neural network. That's my team! And that's a first-class informal education. </p>
<p>Go Patriots! </p>
