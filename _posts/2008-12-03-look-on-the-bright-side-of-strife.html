This morning on Marketplace, <a href="http://caseymulligan.blogspot.com/2008/09/wall-street-will-drown-alone.html">I crib from Casey Mulligan</a> and argue that we shouldn't let the meltdown of the financial sector trick us into thinking that the real economy and the recession is worse than it really is. Also, government shouldn't <em>make</em> it worse.
