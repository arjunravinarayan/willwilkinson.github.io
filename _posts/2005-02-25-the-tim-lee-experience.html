As some of you have gratefully noted, I've temporarily given social security blogging a rest. However, my colleague Tim Lee is on the ball. Tim <a href="http://www.binarybits.org/archives/2005/02/transition_cost.html">points out</a> that Yglesias is either being shady or doesn't know what  he talking about in his article on transition costs to personal accounts. And, looking at the debate between Kevin Drum and Will Saletan over the retirement age, <a href="http://www.binarybits.org/archives/2005/02/retirement_libe.html">Tim wisely wonders</a> why we got ourselves into the sort of system where extremely personal issues, like the age at which people choose to retire, becomes a matter government policy.
