This is just too flattering to resist sharing. <a href="http://lehmann.typepad.com/in_lehmanns_terms/">R.J. Lehmann</a>, listing "the top five new persons, places or things I was introduced to in the last 12 months that combined to make 2005, all in all, a very good year," puts Joanna & I, as a unit, at #2.

<blockquote>2. Willana -- Or, if you prefer, Robkinson. Individually, they're <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/about/">Wilko</a> and <a href="http://www.feyaccompli.com/index.php?p=48">J-Ro</a>. Together, they're the ultimate D.C. libertarian power couple, the Brangelina of the <a href="http://www.americasfuture.org/index.php">A.F.F.</a> set. But as if being Triple-Bs (that's "brilliant beautiful bloggers") weren't enough, prophecy foretells they shall one day conceive the annointed one, and unto him shall the gathering of radical individualists be. And he shalt smite the state, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And he shall be really, really ridiculously good-looking. And men shall call him...the Anti-Marx!</blockquote>

Of course, "the Brangelina of the AFF set" is sort of like "the Stephen Hawking of the Appalachians," but we really like the idea anyway. Also, this reminds me that I've been meaning to write about the demographic strategy for libertarians. And Ray I think just won himself a dinner invitation to casa Willana.
