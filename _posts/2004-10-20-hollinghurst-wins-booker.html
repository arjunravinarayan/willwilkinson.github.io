I'm delighted to see that Alan Hollinghurst has been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3757748.stm">awarded the Booker Prize</a> for his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582345082/theflybottle-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1"><em>The Line of Beauty</em></a>. Hollinghurst is one of my favorite authors, his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679722564/theflybottle-20?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1"><em>Swimming Pool Library</em></a> being one of the most exquisitely written novels I've ever read. I hadn't known he had a new novel out, and I'm excited to read it.

[NB: If you buy Hollinghurst novels from Amazon, Amazon will infer that you like "gay" novels. Not that there is... you know.]
