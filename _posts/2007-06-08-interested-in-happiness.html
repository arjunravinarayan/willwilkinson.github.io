Thanks to Tyler at Marginal Revolution (who sent me the paper in the first place), I see my somewhat cryptic post on the new NBER happiness study has been linked by Brad DeLong and Kevin Drum. In case anyone is stumbling on this blog for the first time, and is interested in this whole "happiness research" business, let me point you to my recent Cato Institute paper, "<a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=8179">In Pursuit of Happiness Research: Is It Reliable? What Does it Imply for Policy</a>."

Or why not try the April <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/archives/april-2007/"><em>Cato Unbound</em> discussion of happiness research</a> featuring Darrin McMahon, Barry Schwartz, Ruut Veenhoven, and me?
