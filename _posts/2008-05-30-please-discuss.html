<strong>1)</strong> Libertarians and many conservatives often talk about lower taxes as a matter of liberty. But a higher tax isn't <em>more </em>coercive than a lower one. You're either being coerced or you're not. A guy who mugs five people with thin wallets is no less guilty of coercion than a guy who mugs five people with thick wallets. The <em>harm </em>from coercion might be greater if more is taken, but there is no more or less coercion. But if you don't think that the size of the opportunity set is a matter of liberty, then you should not think of lower taxes as a gain in liberty, but just as a reduction in harm. Yet libertarians and conservatives don't tend to talk this way. Why not?

<strong>2) </strong>The average citizen of Singapore has fewer politically recognized rights but is freer than the average citizen of India.
