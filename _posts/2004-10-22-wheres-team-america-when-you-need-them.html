I happen to be watching <a href="http://insider.tv.yahoo.com/index.html">The Insider</a>, which is, apparently, an organ of the John Kerry for President campaign. It's one long blowjob. We've got Brad Pitt's "passionate stump speech" at the University of Missouri; fawning Edwards interview in Iowa; heroic clips from <a href="http://www.goingupriver.com/">Going Upriver</a>; Christopher Reeves hot wife; inside a Kerry campaign bus with Chris Heinz. Words from Bush supporters? Yup. Laura Bush saying that John Edwards is "pretty cute!" Check out the Edwards family photo album on the homepage. Sinclair ain't got nothin' on this!
