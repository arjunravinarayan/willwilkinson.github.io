I've cited this <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/alesina/papers/HappIneqREVApril3.pdf">Alesina et. al paper</a> that reportsthat the widespread belief in high income mobility is the source of the fact that high inequality has no negative effect on the self-reported happiness of poor Americans, but a significant negative effect for wealthier Americans, who understand that mobility is a two way street, and that the inequality gap is the distance one can fall. Well, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/18/AR2005101801698_pf.html">here's a bit of survey evidence</a> on the the less wealthy side of the equation, reported in the Washington Post:

<blockquote>About two-thirds locally and nationally say there's a good chance they will be rich someday. Nearly one-third also predict they'll be famous, including a majority of local African American teens, who expect both celebrity and riches. Even many less affluent black teens foresee wealth and fame: a finding that may indicate reassuring confidence -- or media-fed delusions.</blockquote>

It's not clear to me what "rich" is supposed to mean here. I wonder if a certain amount is specified in the poll question. If it's up to the kids to interpret, then almost all of them may be correct. I remember thinking that $100,000 per year made you rich as a teenager. There's a good chance I'll get there, sooner or later. Of course, I won't see it as rich when I do. (I already don't.) However, fame is much more of a winner-take-all market, even if we're talking "ghetto famous." So, clearly, someone's going to be disappointed.
