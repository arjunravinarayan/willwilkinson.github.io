Brian Thomas Gallagher piles on Fairey <a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/styles-radical-shill">today at </a><em><a href="http://www.nplusonemag.com/styles-radical-shill">N+1</a></em>. Gallagher seems more disturbed by the fact that Fairey makes money from corporate clients than by the fact that he volunteered as a tool for a mainstream American politician. Personally, I find political power scarier than Saks 5th Ave, but it all exposes Fairey's radical pose for what it is. Most importantly, Gallagher is right that Fairey's work is boring.  And I liked this bit:
<blockquote>[O]ne fears that in skewering Fairey, one is potentially pinning down who Obama might turn out to be: a mere bundle of associations, linked—inevitably and irretrievably—with movements he did not start, a politics he does not support, and a transformation he cannot possibly represent. In the image, past ideologies and present branding beautifully fuse in a political tableau distant from any actual politics.</blockquote>
