It's from the America's Future Foundation Valentine's Day panel on courtship and dating (about internet dating, really). My comments on internet dating boiled down to: it's just like regular dating, but with the internet. Anyway, 'twas fun. Also, here I am looking <a href="http://americasfuture.org/affpics/valentinesdayrt2004/pages/pic25.htm">not at all lasciviously</a> at the hot-but-anchor woman/Laura Bush-looking writer from the Washington Post. That would be the lovely Kelly Jane Torrance to my left. [In the picture at the link, not the one in this post.]  And for the love of all that is holy, don't look at <a href="http://americasfuture.org/affpics/valentinesdayrt2004/pages/pic34.htm">this</a>.

[Update: Oh, and <a href="http://americasfuture.org/affpics/valentinesdayrt2004/pages/pic26.htm">here</a> is a really cute one of <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/notes.html">Julian</a> and my pal and housemate Kelly, no doubt being amused by my rapier wit. Or fart jokes. One of those.]
