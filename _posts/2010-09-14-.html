Here’s what they mean: from 1999 until today, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Boehner <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=Career&amp;type=I&amp;cid=N00003675&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=0">has raised $299,490 from lobbyists</a>.

For comparison, Harry Reid, Blanche Lincoln, and Chuck Schumer have each <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?cycle=2010&amp;ind=K02">raised more money from lobbyists in this cycle alone</a>.

This election cycle, Boehner is not even in <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=K02&amp;cycle=2010&amp;recipdetail=H&amp;mem=Y&amp;sortorder=U">the top 20 recipients</a> of lobbyist cash. He’s raised <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cid=N00003675&amp;cycle=2010&amp;type=I&amp;newMem=N&amp;recs=0">less than $40,000</a> from lobbyists this cycle — <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/industries.php?cycle=2010&amp;cid=N00007360&amp;type=I">compared to Nancy Pelosi’s $71,000 from lobbyists</a>.

Sure, Boehner is too close to lobbyists, but the money trail says he isn’t closer than Nancy Pelosi.
