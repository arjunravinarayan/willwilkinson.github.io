This is a bleg for my exceedingly well-informed readers.

Are you aware of any works in moral or political philosophy (or normative political theory) that argue that maintaining a relatively high rate of economic growth is morally mandatory for a good government (or is a necessary condition for justice, or legitimacy, or anything like that). I cannnot find anything along those lines <em>at all</em>, which is a <em>scandal</em>.

I am <em>not</em> looking for an economist who argues in passing that (sufficiently equitably distributed) growth is good because growth=higher incomes=concumption of more preferred bundles of goods=good. I consider that an incredibly persuasive argument, properly construed, but I'm looking for something more by a real normative theorist. I am unwilling to believe that there could be thousands upon thousands of pages on liberty, equality, and even stability, but <em>next to nothing</em> on growth as a cardinal social and political value. So please tell me what I'm missing. I'm probably overlooking something obvious. The closest I can find is Sen, who does link economic growth to the development of basic capabilities, but can be pretty disparaging of growth as an aim.

It's funny; there's tons of stuff on why governments <em>shouldn't</em> care about growth.  God bless the power of economist folk morality, I guess!
