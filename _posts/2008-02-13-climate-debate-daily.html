My one climate post in forever reminds me that I should link to <a href="http://climatedebatedaily.com/">Climate Debate Daily</a>, the new-ish site edited by Denis Dutton (overseer of the famed Arts &amp; Letter's Daily) and Douglas Campbell.

Here's the site's statement of what Denis is up to:
<blockquote>At the University of Canterbury he  has recently introduced a <a href="http://denisdutton.com/110.htm"><strong>new  course</strong></a> on the distinction between science and pseudoscience.  Dr. Dutton is skeptical about the degree to which human activity has  contributed to the general warming trend that began in the 1880s. He  adds, however: "Working at the university where Karl Popper taught  in the 1930s and 40s, I am more than a little aware of the way that  good scientific hypotheses must always be open to falsification. The  best way for science and public policy to proceed is to keep assessing  evidence pro and con for anthropogenic global warming. That is the idea  behind <strong>Climate Debate Daily</strong>."</blockquote>
Good idea. Campbell looks to be a bit more convinced of AGW and thinks action is warranted. But he wants to hash it out. Good man.
