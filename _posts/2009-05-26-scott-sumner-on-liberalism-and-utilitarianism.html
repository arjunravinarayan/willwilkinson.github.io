I'd like to reply to Scott Sumner's penetrating, but I think misguided post defending utilitarianism's connection to liberalism. First, I'd like to emphasize that one need not feel forced to choose between deontological and utilitarian views, especially when reasoning about politics and public policy.

First, there is the question of what liberalism is. In Scott's earlier post on the subject he follows Richard Rorty in definingÂ "liberals as people who believe cruelty is the worst thing we do." As much as I admire Rorty's insights into the inescapable centrality of importance of exhortatory rhetoric, I don't admire bad philosophy or history, which is what this notion of liberalism is. Liberalism, in the first instance, isn't about thinking cruelty is terrible. It is, in the first instance, about freedom and equality. The fundamental liberal assumption is that persons are free and equal. What does that mean? Here's Jerry Gaus, for my money our finest contemporary theorist of liberalism:
<blockquote>To say that each is free implies that each has a fundamental claim to act as she sees fit on the basis of her own reasoning. To say that each is equal is to insist that members of the public are symmetrically placed insofar as no one has a natural right to command others, nor does anyone have a natural duty to defer to the reasoning of others. Given this conception of persons as free and equal, the legal authority of the state, because it is based on the use, and the threat of, force against its citizens, is deeply problematic: state functionaries employ power to force citizens, or issue threats to use force against them, to induce conformity to the law.</blockquote>
Liberalism, right at , raises questions of the legitimacy of the state and state coercion. And, on this conception, the justification of coercion cannot be a matter of adding up its costs and benefits. As Scott nicely explains in his post, even if you wanted to maximize utility, it's not even clear what utility is. Moment-to-moment affect? Global life satisfaction? Some complex eudamonic notion of happiness? Economists tend to see disagreement over standards of evaluation as some kind of methodological inconvenience, but it is in fact at the very core of problem of liberal politics. If we regard people as free and equal -- if we are liberals -- a substantive view of the good cannot simply be applied
