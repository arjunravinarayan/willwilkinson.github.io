Check out the <a href="http://blog.drugpolicy.org/">newish blog</a> from the Drug Policy Alliance (Reason! Compassion!! Justice!!!) written by Baylen Linnekin. Baylen was at an IHS seminar I stage-managed a few years ago, and I had the good fortune of running into him a couple months ago after some AFF thing. Baylen's a good guy. The blog is a very useful compendium of drug-related stories and entertainingly written. Go look.
