Although I doubt he is taking up my challenge to present a non-fluff argument against cloning, Dawson of <a href="http://dawsonspeek.blogspot.com/">dawson.com</a> teases us with this:

<i>Until I have time to expound, expatiate and yes, eviscerate, on the very real evils of cloning, I leave you this quotation from one of my favorite authors:
"A person is a person no matter how small." ~Dr. Suess</i>

Dr. Suess's point is tautological. What does it have to do with the morality of cloning?
