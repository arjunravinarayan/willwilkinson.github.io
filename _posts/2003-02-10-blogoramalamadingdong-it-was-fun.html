<b>Blogoramalamadingdong --</b> It was fun. We should do it again. I seem to be the coverperson (along with the lovely Miss Ahluwalia) over at <a href="http://juliansanchez.com/blogorama.html">Julian's wrap up page</a>. Unfortunately, my expression seems to be of the sort elicited by a visit to the proctologist.

Also, here at Missy's page <a href="http://listenmissy.com/photos/blogorama/will.jpg">looking grave</a> and deceptively conservative, and <a href="http://listenmissy.com/photos/blogorama/smokey.jpg">here</a>, looking like I've just been shot (smoking gun just off camera). I may have been drinking.
