<a href="http://highclearing.com/index.php/archives/2008/11/15/8909">From Thoreau</a> at Unqualified Offerings:
<blockquote>I share the confidence of everyone here in predicting that Obama will successfully resist the rising chorus of rhetoric from across the spectrum, including people on his own side, and renounce the Washington consensus in favor of protection of civil liberties and basic American principles.  I mean, if you can’t trust a guy who rose rapidly through the political game and raised massive amounts of money from all sorts of places in order to acquire the most powerful office in the world, whom can you trust?</blockquote>
Whom indeed?
