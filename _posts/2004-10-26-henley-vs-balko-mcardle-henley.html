I wholeheartedly endorse Jim Henley's <a href="http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2004_10_24.html#005588">endorsement</a> of the Libertarian Party candidate, who just happens to be Michael Badnarik, for what it's worth. Radley and Megan must explain ("must explain" in the sense of "need to explain in order to satsify Will Wilkinson's curiousity") why Jim is wrong.

I especially like Jim's point about the direction of causation for the LP: not lack of votes because of lack of good candidates, but lack of good candidates because of lack of votes.
