Link <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/happiness-on-nightline/">via Justin Wolfers</a>, who asks a tangential question I would very much like to know the answer to:

<blockquote>(An aside: You will note that I referred to Betsey as my co-author, which she is, but that is only a partial description, as she is also my Wharton colleague, and also my longtime significant other. What is the right word for this? “Colleague plus?” I imagine that finding the right language for this is an increasingly common conundrum. Any suggestions?)</blockquote>
