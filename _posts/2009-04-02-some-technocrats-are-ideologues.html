<a href="http://thebrowser.com/robert-cottrell/felix-salmon-1-april-2009">Felix Salmon says</a>:
<blockquote>I do have some sympathy for <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2009/03/simon-johnsons-morality-tale.html" target="_blank">Dani Rodrik’s skepticism when it comes to technocrats</a>, but surely a government of technocrats — which is what I think we now have — is nearly always to be preferred to a government of idealogues.</blockquote>
Perhaps Felix should consider that a large part of the set of technocrats is always a subset of the set of ideologues. I think he means that one prefers technocrats who share one's ideology. Of course!
