Daniel Dennett's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/opinion/28dennett.html?pagewanted=1">NYT essay on intelligent design</a> is spot on from beginning to end. If you're confused about this issue, this is the place to go.

Dennett concludes:

<blockquote>Since there is no content, there is no "controversy" to teach about in biology class. But here is a good topic for a high school course on current events and politics: Is intelligent design a hoax? And if so, how was it perpetrated?</blockquote>

OK, that's a good high school question. But how about a question for adults? Has the hegemony of secularism in public institutions, such as the schools, generated it's own backlash? Is intelligent design  a symptom of a much deeper problem: the failure of our public institutions to embody the ideals of liberal neutrality?
