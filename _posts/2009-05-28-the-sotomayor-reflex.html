God, I hate politics. It really does make people stupid, especially those whose tribe is out of power. When Sonia Sotomayor was nominated, I knew <em>nothing relevant </em>about her judicial philosophy or, much more importantly, about her actual record as a judge. You'd think you'd wait to learn something about this before saying something about her, but no. People just proceeded to go crazy on cue.

<a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/32306.html">Like Damon Root</a>, I'm in favor of libertarian judicial activism. But I know that Barack Obama is no libertarian, and I knew he wasn't going to nominate Kozinski or Posner. Too bad! So I was hoping for a relatively centrist liberal who sees some merit in libertarian arguments, especially about the protection of economic rights. As far as I can tell, there is nothing especially worrying about Sotomayor. She's obviously super-qualified. And from what I've read, she seems like a highly competent, fairly moderate liberal who sticks pretty close to the law (which nobody really likes when they don't like the law!) and is perfectly willing to side with Republican-appointed judges when that seems to her the right thing to do. What are people going batshit crazy over? I don't get it. And I really don't get why many Republicans have taken this opportunity to reinforce the already widespread impression that they are morally odious morons. God, I hate politics.
