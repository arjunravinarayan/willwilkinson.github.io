Just a note to Fly Bottle readers who do not also read my <a href="http://happinesspolicy.com/">Happiness and Public Policy</a> blog... In an attempt to promote my coming-in-April Cato happiness paper, I'm revamping the happiness blog, and have resolved to post there <em>at least</em> once a day from now through a month after the release of the paper (in hopes of following up on any Internet discussion it may provoke [<em>some</em>, I hope!]). I don't want to duplicate all my happiness posts here, or note them every time I write one, so I've installed a little sidebar widget that shows new entries on the happiness blog, as you can see to your right.

I have also resolved to post more here as well, on generally non-happiness stuff, though probably not once a day. So let's see how that goes.
