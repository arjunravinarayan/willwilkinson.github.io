Tyler Cowen's <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/11/my_favorite_phi.html">favorite philosophy blog</a>! Wow! Thanks Tyler! That makes my day.

This means something to me, not only because Tyler was sort of my boss at Mercatus, and because I admire his work immensely, but because Tyler is one of those extremely rare economists who is also an outstanding philosopher (putting him in the company of people like Buchanan and Sen). Tyler has published papers <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/jbc/Tyler/selfliberation.PDF">in Ethics</a>, <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/jbc/Tyler/discountingandrestitution.PDF">in Philosophy and Public Affairs</a>, <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/jbc/Tyler/preferencesovereignty.PDF">in Economics and Philosophy</a>, and has <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/jbc/Tyler/social-discount.PDF">co-authored papers with Derek Parfit</a>, an enviable record for just about any philosopher. But that's just in his spare time.
