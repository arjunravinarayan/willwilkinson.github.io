A group of economists assembled at the behest of French president Nikolas Sarkozy, the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, has unveiled its major report. The commission, led by left-leaning Nobel Prize-winning economists George Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, was charged with the task of exploring methods for better measuring human well-being. I've yet to read read the entire 292 page report, but a cursory glance at the executive summary confirms what I had suspected: the report is a sophisticated but ultimately arbitrary blend of ideology and social science.

Here's what I gleaned about the commitments of the Commission from the summary. I'm sure there's a great deal of internal disagreement and nuance introduced in the body the report, so I offer this interpretation of the Commission's stance provisionally.

The Commission:
<ul>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff; ">Largely accepts Sen's capabilities theory of well-being -- i.e., well-being is an objective matter of the development of certain human "functionings."</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Accepts that well-being has a subjective component and that this can be captured by survey and other self-report methods.</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Accepts the social-scientific validity of using the populations of nation-states as the primary subjects of measurement, analysis, and comparison (analytic nationalism).</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Accepts the philosophical validity of using the nation-state as the relevant unit of moral evaluation and normative policy evaluation (normative nationalism).</span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Seems to accept what might be called "democratic fundamentalism," the view that the ability to participate in democratic political institutions by its nature contributes positively to well-being regardless of the structure of those institutions or the outcomes they tend to produce. (Looks like this may follow from accepting "voice" as an item on Sen's list of objective, well-being constituting attributes.) </span></li>
	<li><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Accepts that there is an environmental "crisis" and that continued economic growth, as it is presently achieved, is therefore not ecologically "sustainable."</span></li>
</ul>
Whatever you might make of this cluster of commitments, it's not ideologically neutral. Of course, the more you like the ideology, the more sensibly impartial it seems! The partiality is easier to see when you consider what kinds of possibilities for improving human well-being become harder rather than easier to see once these commitments are accepted.

I take it that just about everyone these days agrees that levels of both objective and subjective well-being (however you want to measure these) rise rapidly with rising income for those with very low incomes. So any policy that quickly increases the incomes of the world's poor will tend to deliver very large increases in world well-being. Now, I'm convinced that by far the most promising policy for increasing the income of the world's poor is wealthy countries agreeing making their labor markets more open to workers from poor countries. Lant Pritchett's powerful book <em><a href="http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/10174">Let Their People Come</a></em> shows that income gains to the poor from even slightly relaxed restrictions of labor mobility exceed the gains from all other development and poverty alleviation measures <em>many times over</em>.

A swift search of the Commission's report shows a small handful of mentions of immigration, mostly related to immigration's tendency to increase inequality within rich countries. Glancing at these passages, I saw no mention of the fact that immigration-related within-country increases in inequality represent decreases in world inequality and increases in average world well-being.

The report conveys a strong concern for political "voice." Many of you will be familiar with Albert O. Hircschman's <em>Exit, Voice</em>, and <em>Loyalty. </em>Given that national citizenship at birth is the single strongest determinant of income, health, longevity, etc., and given the potentially immense gains to world well-being from increased labor mobility, one might imagine that rights of "exit" would also get some emphasis in the report. But my text searches so far reveal a total disregard for exit or mobility rights. Yet if there is reason to accept political voice as an objective well-being-constituting capability, then there is equal or greater reason to accept the ability to cross borders in search of better conditions. As far as I can tell, the Commission's indifference to exit and mobility are totally arbitrary.

None of this is surprising. GDP measures are nationalistic by definition and "alternatives to GDP" projects tend to be motivated by a desire of certain political factions for alternative, more ideologically amenable within-country performance metrics. But I think it is important as a matter of both science and philosophy that we not simply assume the legitimacy of the status-quo world system for carving up territory, populations, and political jurisdictions. This system itself profoundly affects the level and distribution of human well-being. If the point of better measuring well-being is to enable us to better evaluate policy, then we need to be sure that how and what we measure doesn't simply take for granted, and therefore conceal from view, policies that may be retarding social progress and causing immense harm to well-being.

The politics of nation-states being what it is, I understand the desire of those deeply involved in their country's politics to seek "scientific" validation of the policies they would like the government of their local state to implement. But we need to be careful not to confuse well-being-measurement projects pursued for this parochial purpose with well-being-measurement projects motivated by broader humanitarian concerns.
