Here's Yale psychologist Paul Bloom talking with UNC experimental philosopher Joshua Knobe about the evidence for our native bias toward theism. (Don't worry! The clip's just 3 minutes.) Everything he says could just as well be applied to folk ideas about planned economies versus spontaneous orders:

Knobe goes on to mention that people seem to revert back to a childlike penchant for intention-based agentive explanation when we become old. Maybe we need to put an age limit on policymakers.
