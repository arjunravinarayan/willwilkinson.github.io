I spent today reading <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1586488856/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=1586488856&amp;adid=0V2F2VQS4S37VCBG2TD8&amp;">The Soros Lectures</a></em>Â by George Soros and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0470139889/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0470139889&amp;adid=1GT2A7ETB05XP9MR0P4M&amp;">The Science of Success</a></em> by Charles G. Koch. I now know everything necessary to become insanely wealthy. Or at least to write a Big Think blog post comparing and contrasting the surprisingly similar philosophies of America's most maligned philanthropists. The point of this post is to pressure myself to actually write about this so that in the off chance market-based management and the principle of reflexivity don't soon make me one of the world's wealthiest men, my day wasn't a waste.
