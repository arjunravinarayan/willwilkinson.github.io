I've got a <a href="http://catallarchy.net/blog/archives/2005/06/03/poverty-not-wealth-is-unnatural/#comment-34679">blog post-length comment</a> on <a href="http://catallarchy.net/blog/archives/2005/06/03/poverty-not-wealth-is-unnatural/">this post</a> by Jonathan Wilde over at Catallarchy. This is what you get today.

I've got all sorts of interesting things stored up to report on & ruminate about. <a href="http://www.gruterinstitute.org/MainConference.htm">Gruter Institute</a> conference on the values of the free enterprise system. <a href="http://www.aei.org/events/eventID.1072,filter.all/event_detail.asp">AEI conference on neuro-morality</a>. Drinks with <a href="http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/">Pinker</a>. Hannah & Martin. Perhaps tomorrow, should I have world enough, and time (but if we're tearing our pleasures with rough strife thorough the iron gates of life, then forget it.)
