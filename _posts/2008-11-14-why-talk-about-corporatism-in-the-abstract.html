... when <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/opinion/columns/TimothyCarney/Emanuel_Used_Political_Connections_to_Leverage_Personal_Wealth.html">Tim Carney can tell you </a>how Rahm Emanuel, Obama's new right-hand man, made over $16 million in 2 1/2 years? Â Change we can believe in, people.

By the way, I wouldn't be so keen on hammering on Obama if there weren't so many people out there who seem to believe that the man is something other than a successful politician. It's better to get the disappointment out of the way.
