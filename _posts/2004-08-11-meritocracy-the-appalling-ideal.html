Over at TCS I <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/081104F.html">try to parry the thrust</a> of <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2004/07/selfmade_men.html">this Matt Yglesias blog post</a>. I argue that it is in fact possible to deserve what once has worked for, and that there are in fact self-made men who deserve credit for their achievements. I don't believe these are controversial propositions, aside from a few sholastic dissenters. But I think this is a case where it's worthwhile bolstering common sense.

[NB: I have nothing to do whatsoever with the red donkey illustration.]
