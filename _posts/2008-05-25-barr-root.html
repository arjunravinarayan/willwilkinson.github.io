I am not excited. Nor would I have been excited had Mary Ruwart taken. Mike Gravel? Now <em>that</em> would have excited me. I just like that guy, and I think he has a much better claim to being libertarian that Bob Barr, who voted for the PATRIOT Act oh so many years ago. And Wayne Allyn Root struck me as a first-class tool at the Reason event. So my LP enthusiasm meter remains, as always, pegged close to zero. But since I insist on expressively voting in presidential elections, finding nothing preferable on my ballot, I may well vote Libertarian, as is my habit.
