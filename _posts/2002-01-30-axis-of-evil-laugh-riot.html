<b>Axis of Evil: Laugh Riot</b> -- If the Axis of Evil held an Olympics of self-satire, North Korea would sweep the gold. At the <a href="http://www.kcna.co.jp/">official North Korean website</a>, one can read side-splittingly banal anecdotes about Kim Jong Il, such as this inspiring gem:

<i>It happened when the president gave field guidance to Kaesong area on September 14, Juche 61 (1972). He asked officials there what was the special food of the area.

None of them could give a correct answer to the questions repeatedly put by him in the course of the on-the-spot guidance.

While visiting factories in the city he met old men who had lived there for years and found out that loach soup was a special food of the city.

And he made sure that a new restaurant was built there to serve only loach soup to the customers.</i>

Gripping!

And don't miss these breaking stories!

<i>"Comrade Kim Jong Il, The Great Leader Of The Juche-Oriented Revolutionary Cause" (five volumes), a library comprehensively dealing with his greatness, on the occasion of his birthday.</i>

It's easy to laugh in the face of evil when you just can't help it!
