<b>The Frigging Enlightenment</b> -- Conservatives take a "chinese menu" attitude toward the Enlightment, picking up threads they deem properly sanctified by heaven and history, while leaving out some of the best parts -- like men's clubs that <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,635688,00.html">celebrated the liberating power of regular wanking</a>, as this Guardian review reveals.

Best line:

<i>Forward- looking proponents of commerce, members seem to have been enthusiasts for both free trade and free love. A prize possession was a snuffbox donated by honorary member George IV containing pubic hair from one of his mistresses. </i>

Who wants to start a club? Let us now praise Enlightenment men!
