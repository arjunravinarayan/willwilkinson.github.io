Check out <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/05/04/declan-mccullagh/what-larry-didnt-get/">Declan McCullagh's lead essay</a> in this month's <em>Cato Unbound</em>, a reconsideration of Larry Lessig's <em>Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace </em>after ten years (can you believe it!) Lessig himself will reply, as will Adam Thierer and Jonathan Zittrain.
