My recent blogging efforts have been directed to Cato@Liberty. Here's one from yesterday on <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/08/09/exit-against-predation/">the right of exit versus political predation</a>, and here's one from Tuesday on <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/08/08/pluralism-and-school-choice/">pluralism and school choice</a>.

And keep  eye an out for the <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/08/10/the-editors/coming-monday-mexicans-in-america/">new <em>Cato Unbound</em> next Monday</a>. Essayist Richard Rodriguez will kick things off with a meditation on "Mexicans in America," our topic for August. Victor Davis Hanson is first in line to reply. Should be good.
