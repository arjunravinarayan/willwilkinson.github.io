-- I'm jacked about the announcement that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/01/business/yourmoney/01goog.html?pagewanted=1&adxnnl=0&adxnnlx=1075710933-KRIavoq6O4XRMS/YY5O1RQ">Google plans to scan</a> everything in the Stanford library published before 1923. That should make a huge chunk of the important (and unimportant) works in philosophy available for free. Go Google!

This is, by the way, what Microsoft is really good for. It puts the fear of Jesus in the Googles of the world, and makes 'em hustle to make us happy. So what I'm really hoping for is that Microsoft comes close in the search war, and succeeds in creating a superfast integrated search in Windows that allows me to search my own measly 30gb hard drive at something close to the speed that Google manages to search the whole goddam internet, but falls short in the end because of all the glorious innovations the Google geniuses lay at our feet in order to keep us from straying.

Who loves markets? <em><strong>I</strong></em> love markets!
