<a href="http://www.cultureby.com/trilogy/archives/000221.html">Grant McCracken</a> puts the point I was trying to make below much more clearly than I did. . .

<blockquote>This is a problem with a large part of the Democrat base. They will not accept that the opposition has a position. They prefer to think of ideology as symptomatology . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Democrats, so deeply feeling, so prepared to feel someoneâ€™s pain, have failed at this simply anthropological task: know the other as they know themselves. Or at least well enough to take them on.</blockquote>

This point feeds directly into the theme of my talk on the relationship between identity and belief at Cato U last week. I'll try to expand on this later if I get a chance.
