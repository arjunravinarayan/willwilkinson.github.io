I've got to say, I was <em>way </em>ahead of the curve on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/23/fashion/thursdaystyles/23BEARDS.html?ex=1300770000&en=751d6a3b52a4357f&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">this one</a>. In my book, the beard's played. I've been absolutely certain for several months now that the Burt Reynolds/Tom Selleck mustache is set for a raging return. I wish to be on the crest of that wave. But keeping the beard is one of those little things I do for the lady.

But tell me truly: is this not what a man should look like?

<a class="imagelink" title="Burt!" href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/znaniBurt%20Reynolds.jpg"><img id="image937" alt="Burt!" src="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/wp-content/uploads/2006/03/znaniBurt%20Reynolds.jpg" /></a>

Yes. Yes it is.
