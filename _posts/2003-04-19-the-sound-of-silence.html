-- I hope you've enjoyed my experiment in meditative blog silence. If you thought I was inactive, you must have succumbed to my well-wrought <i>illusion</i> of stasis. More discerning readers will have noticed how each new day, my apparently unchanging page was commenting subtly--passively protesting the hectic, frantic hurly burly of the world at large. The silence takes on new overtones as its steady note interweaves with the symphony of human endeavor creating ever-shifting harmonies and dissonances. You missed it, didn't you? Next time, listen harder.
