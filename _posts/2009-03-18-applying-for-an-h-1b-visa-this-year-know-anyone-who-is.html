If you can help with <a href="http://www.cgdev.org/content/general/detail/1421300/">this important study </a>(conducted by Michael Clemens of the Center for Global Development) please do: 
<blockquote>APPLYING FOR AN H-1B VISA THIS YEAR?  KNOW ANYONE WHO IS?

A major academic study seeks volunteers to help document how US limits on skilled-worker visas affect the careers of foreign students and workers like you.

The supply of H-1B visas is so limited that many applicants will be rejected by the luck of the draw.  This study, run by a Washington DC research institute, will track what happens to the careers of those who are rejected and those who are accepted, by asking you to complete two brief and confidential online questionnaires.

The visa lottery begins soon, so visit the study’s website today to learn more:

The goverment literally distributes visas, so if this isn't an issue of distributive justice, then it's hard to know what is.  The way the government goes about this I'm guessing has a pretty dramatic effect on th lives of people granted and denied those visas. It would be great to know what the effect really is.
