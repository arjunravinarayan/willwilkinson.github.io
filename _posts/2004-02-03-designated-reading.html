-- I'm happy to see that my former advisor, Michael Devitt, has made his book, <a href="http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Philosophy/Devitt/designation.pdf"><em>Designation</em></a>, available on his website. <em>Designation</em> is one of the best works in the philosophy of language published in the 80's (perhaps the only systematic working through of the Kripke/Donnellan casual theories), yet has been out of print for a number of years, and is almost totally impossible to find through used booksellers.  Check it out. Devitt is an exceptionally clear, even punchy, writer who is able to make a very dry subject matter come (somewhat) alive.

Also, check out the many papers on his CUNY website. "<a href="http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Philosophy/devitt/NOAPRIOR.DOC">There is No A Priori</a>" is nice, and "<a href="http://web.gc.cuny.edu/Philosophy/devitt/world.doc">Worldmaking Made Hard</a>," which begins "In part I of this paper I shall demonstrate the horror of a doctrine I call 'Worldmaking'," gives something of the flavor of a Devitt seminar, wherein he rails against philosophers who would sacrifice the world of stones, cats, and trees for a world of words. (It's always "stones, cats, and trees." If in a more theoretical and scientific bent, we almost always get  "electrons, muons, and curved space-time." This comforts me.)
