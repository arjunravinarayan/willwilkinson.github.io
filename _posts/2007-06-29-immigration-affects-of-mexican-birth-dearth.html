Mexican birthrates are plummeting, according to GW economist Robert Dunn in <em><a href="http://american.com/archive/2007/june-0607/mexican-immigration-will-solve-itself">The American</a>:</em>
<blockquote>Some politicians fear that we are being “Mexicanized.” In fact the opposite may be underway. NAFTA, our mass media, the more widespread use of English, and the large number of people going back and forth (legally or otherwise) mean that Mexicans are increasingly influenced by our culture, and that implies fewer babies. The United States also has a fertility rate of 2.1, but that is the same as it was in 1990. Mexico is becoming more similar to the United States, which must frustrate their nationalists.

The main point for the United States is that we have only a temporary problem with illegal immigration from Mexico. For another decade or a bit more we must attempt to limit such entry, but then the problem will fade like the smile on the Cheshire Cat. Lou Dobbs, Rep. Tancredo and their nationalistic friends can calm down and relax.</blockquote>
Then we expand NAFTA to include a common labor market and bring in low-wage labor from even poorer countries.
