From the WSJ ($$$) there is this triumph of exegesis from David Lewis Schaeffer:
<blockquote>Unlike the great political philosophers of the Western tradition from Aristotle to Locke to Rousseau, Rawls did not ground his account of justice in an empirical examination of human nature or political life. He also left his principles of justice at such an extreme level of generality that they pointed to no specific political conclusions, certainly not the ones attributed to them by his followers. Rawls's precept that "liberty may be restricted only for the sake of liberty" offered no guidance as to how different forms of liberty (say, Americans' right to freedom from terror attacks compared with the ostensible right to privacy) should be balanced against one another. Nor could Rawls demonstrate that any particular level of economic inequality violated his difference principle: If (as may well be the case) allowing corporate executives to earn annual incomes of tens of millions of dollars helps to generate the economic dynamism that raises Americans' living standards, including those of the poor, such inequalities are allowable.
<p class="times">What Rawls contributed to the political education of American intellectuals was not any sort of rigorous analysis, but an overall spirit or outlook detrimental to freedom. He coined a doctrine of what he called "excusable envy," according to which it is rational to envy people whose superiority in wealth exceeds certain (unspecified) limits, and to act on that passion. He cancelled out his ostensible prioritization of liberty by holding that liberty must first be given its "fair value," meaning that political liberties, including freedom of the press, may need to be restricted so as to ensure that the political process yields legislation that is "fair" to the poor. In his later writings, increasingly deferential to the Marxist critique of liberalism, Rawls wrote that securing people's equal rights and liberties must be preceded by government's first having ensured that their "basic needs" for economic goods were met -- thus sanctioning the alibis offered by assorted despots for violating their subjects' elemental rights to free speech, the freedom from arbitrary arrest, and the security of individual life and property.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="times">The last third of <em>A Theory of Justice</em> is based firmly on 1960's-70s moral psychology. Mostly untrue, but so is Locke's associationism. I am not clear on Rousseau's great claim to empiricism. If Rawls's principles are general, then maybe that is because he is doing <em>philosophy, </em>specifically what he called "ideal theory," which is the attempt to identify the principles of a good society assuming perfect compliance with those principles. Once we have the target, <em>then </em>we take the contingent constraints of current political reality into account in our non-ideal theory of practical politics. Let me say, parenthetically, that the contrast between "right to freedom from terror attacks" and the "ostensible [!!!] right to privacy" is downright embarrassing. Rawls also does not tell us how to balance the right to the freedom from the anxieties of self-responsibility with the <em>alleged </em>freedom of <em> </em>consumer choice. Because he was not an idiot. </p>
