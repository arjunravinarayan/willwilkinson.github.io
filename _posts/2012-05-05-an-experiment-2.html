Okay. Until we move to Houston, I'm trying to pick up the blogging pace. I've been collecting lots of links as I hunt for bloggable items, and it occurred to me that link-blogging, with a quick comment now and again, might be a good use of this space, which I would like to keep alive. So I'm gonna try it for the next week and see how it goes. If it's a hassle or a time-suck, I'll quit. If it's no sweat, maybe I can make some beer money. The smart bet is on quitting, but sometimes I surprise myself.
