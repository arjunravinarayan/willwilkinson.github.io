Almost everything about the execution of yesterday’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/nyregion/police-begin-clearing-zuccotti-park-of-protesters.html">eviction of protesters from Zuccotti Park</a> was an outrage, from the <a href="http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/11/occupy-wall-street-police-raid-eviction">interference with reporters seeking to cover the event</a>, to the needless destruction of protesters’ property, to Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s <a href="http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/david/bloomberg-defies-court-order-allowing-protes">stunningly lawless disregard for a court order restraining the city</a>. But on the underlying question of whether the city <em>must</em> allow any group to set up a tent city in public space indefinitely, I think Doug Mataconis gets it right: <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/camping-out-in-a-park-is-not-a-first-amendment-right/">There’s no First Amendment right to camp out in a park</a>, and no reason to think that there’s anything constitutionally offensive about a content-neutral rule designed to ensure that public parks can continue to be used as, well, parks. People, of course, have every right to speak their mind in public (or, in this instance, quasi-public) space. But laying down dozens of tents and announcing that you and your friends intend to live there indefinitely always sounded suspiciously like an attempt to, in effect, <em>privatize</em> that public space.

I’ve always had a similar reaction to that hoary protest chant: “Whose Streets? Our Streets! Whose Park? Our Park!” Here we’re supposed to understand that “our” means “the people” as a whole. But protesters—even when they call themselves “The 99%”—comprise a pretty minuscule fraction of a percent of the population of a city the size of New York.  In practice, “our” means “this particular group of people,” even if they aspire to represent a much larger group. We don’t put expressive rights to a vote, fortunately, but it does seem like a whole bunch of democratically elected city officials are under the impression that their constituents want <em>their</em> parks to remain usable for traditionally park-ish purposes. Maybe they’re wrong, of course, or maybe that’s a pretext offered to squelch a threat to their corporate paymasters. But it always seems presumptuous when soi-disant populist movements, left and right, declare that “we the people” want this or that.
