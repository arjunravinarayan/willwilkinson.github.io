JONATHAN CHAIT apparently <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/the_plank?pid=141339">is unimpressed</a> by citations to the work of personages such as Martin Feldstein, the president of the prestigious National Bureau of Economic Research and the George F. Baker Professor of Economics at Harvard University. Indeed, Mr Chait has a knack for drawing the bounds of intellectual respectability so tightly around himself that by early afternoon even his shadow falls outside the charmed circle. Even so, one must admit that Mr Feldstein's Bates Clark medal and his <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30611FE35540C758CDDA90994DD404482">endorsement by the New York Times</a> for the job of Chairman of the Federal Reserve does leave one with a residue of suspicion. The Bank of Sweden has not bestowed upon him its coveted prize -- though it's true he has been mentioned, specifically for his work on the theory of taxation. So let's not be too hasty to take him seriously. 

Because Mr Chait is a self-avowed empiricist, perhaps he will favor this new paper by Christina and David Romer of the Univesity of California, Berkeley (despite somewhat embarrasing credentials, even more lackluster than Mr Feldstein's). It is a dazzling empirical investigation of the effects of tax cuts and increases on economic output in the United States since the end of the second World War that significantly improves on earlier attempts to estimate the effects of tax changes. They find that
<blockquote>tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output. Since most of our exogenous tax changes are in fact reductions, the more intuitive way to express this result is that tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects.</blockquote>
Mr and Ms Romer looked at every tax change legislated at the national level. More impressively, they scoured "presidential speeches, executive-branch documents, and Congressional reports ... to identify the size, timing, and principal motivation for all major postwar tax policy actions." They then categorized each tax change based on whether or not they were intended as forward-looking corrections to the direction of the economy (they call these "endogenous" changes), or for other reasons, such as to reduce an inherited deficit or boost growth (the "exogenous" changes.) This allows them to tease out the output effects of tax cuts and tax increases put in place for different reasons.

Interestingly, they found that the motivation behind tax cuts and increases has varied over time. Changes in taxes motivated by spending changes was common from the 50s through the 70s, but not since then.  "Counter-cyclical" changes were in vogue for a decade from the mid-60s to the mid- 70s. Tax increases to reduce inherited deficits were practically unknown before the late 70s, and since the early 90s. Only They found that almost all tax changes since about 1980 have been "exogenous," generally intended to stimulate growth 

to identify the size, timing, and principal motivation for all major postwar tax policy actions   

Our baseline specification suggests that an exogenous tax increase of one percent of GDP lowers real
GDP by roughly three percent.

New empirical evidence of the effects changing tax rates comes from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w13264" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)">Christina and David <span name="st" id="st" class="st">Romer</span>'s July state-of-the-art NBER paper </a>, which tracks the effect various kinds of tax changes in the United States since WWII. They find that
<blockquote>tax increases appear to have a very large, sustained, and highly significant negative impact on output. Since most of our exogenous tax changes are in fact reductions, the more intuitive way to express this result is that tax cuts have very large and persistent positive output effects. </blockquote>
They don't discuss revenue effects, but their analysis of the historical record does suggest the hypothesis that the longer-run growth effects of tax cuts have indeed in the past increased tax revenue relative to the counterfactual timeline in which taxes were not cut.

Interestingly, the Romers find that not all tax hikes hurt the same. They find that tax increases specifically intended to offset budget deficits largely avoid the negative effects of other kinds of increases, in part by improving the climate of investor confidence.

This suggests to me that a savvy "reality-based" politician might propose a small tax increase, together with budget cuts, intended specifically to balance the budget. But this should be proposed in tandem with a promise that once the budget is balanced, the increase will be rescinded, and taxes and spending will be slashed further to stimulate long-run growth. But no one has asked me.
