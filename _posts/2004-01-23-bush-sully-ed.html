-- It's not often these days that I say this, but I think Andrew Sullivan is <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=fisking&s=sullivan012104">spot on</a> about the SOTU. If I didn't agree entirely with Chris Sciabarra about <a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/3138.html"> the irrelevance of the presidency</a> given the structural immutability of the American political system (great post, read it), then I too would be shopping for a Dem to back.
