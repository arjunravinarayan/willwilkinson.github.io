That's "appearing on" not "talking about". This week on Free Will, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/10593">I chat with philosopher Geoffrey Sayre-McCord</a> about the nature of metaethics in general and moral realism in particular. Since metaethics was, at one point, my academic specialty (I went into the Ph.D. program at Maryland with a mind to work on the nature of moral concepts), I really, really enjoyed this chat. I hope to have Geoff back on to talk about issues of naturalism and evolutionary thinking in moral philosophy.
