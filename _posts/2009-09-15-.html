Each individual morally ought to rationally pursue his or her own life and happiness. This is best done in cooperation with others, but only in a context of mutual respect for individual rights. An individual has one main right, the right to do what he or she morally ought to do: to rationally pursue his or her own life and happiness. The success of this pursuit is impossible without the right to the product of one's efforts, that is, without property rights. So property rights are a implied by the individual's right to his or her own life. Recognition of individual rights constrains the individual's pursuit of his or her life and happiness: one may not use coercively interfere with another individual's peaceful activities or take their rightful property. Our one binding moral obligation to other people is to leave them and their leave their stuff alone.

Still with me? OK. So what about government? Government is necessary because only government can provide two public goods having to do with the regulation of violence. First, there is defense against external aggressors. Second, there is civil peace established by state protection of individual rights through the rule of law. These legitimate functions of government must be financed. Rand tentatively suggests that government can be financed through a voluntary fee paid to the government to guarantee the enforcement of contracts. She doesn't pretend to know that this will work. But the upshot of her thinking is very clear. Government provides an important service to the people under its jurisdiction. It is their agent. It works for them. People owe government for providing services they require from government in the same way they owe private businesses for services ordered and rendered. Government has no more legitimate claim on their income or wealth than does anyone else, except insofar as it is like a party to an contract one has entered into voluntarily. Rand gropes for a voluntary mechanism for financing monopoly government because she thinks that the coercive power to tax verges on a feudal model in which everyone's life and work is ultimately owned by the monarch. Even when the government of the state is democratic, if it is insufficiently constrained and limited, it will sooner or later start forcing people to pay for government-provided services that could be better provided by voluntary means. Worse, insufficiently limited democratic government will become a source of civil conflict, as competing groups fight to use the state to loot each other.

Devotees may quibble, but I think this is a pretty accurate account of the Randian picture. I think it's got lots of problems.
