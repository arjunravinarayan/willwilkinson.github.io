Don Boudreaux <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2008/07/a-cause-for-app.html">once again displays</a> his weirdly rare ability to describe things correctly:
<blockquote><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080724/ap_on_bi_ge/minimum_wage">The national minimum-wage rises today from $5.85 per hour to $6.55 per hour</a>.Â  In other words, Uncle Sam today arbitrarily increases the cost of employing low-skilled workers by 12 percent.</blockquote>
If your labor is worth less the $6.55 per hour, life is probably not easy for you. It's a travesty that politicians can posture like they're helping that guy by making it illegal for anyone to profit from hiring him. Thankfully, $6.55 still isn't very much.
