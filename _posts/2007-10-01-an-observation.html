While watching her <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-cusack/huffpost-exclusive-my-in_b_65990.html">interview with a fawning Jon Cusack</a>, I realized that Naomi Klein is to Milton Friedman, a great humanitarian and intellectual she repeatedly slanders, something rather less than what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Behe">Michael Behe</a> is to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>. The difference is that Behe actually understands a good deal of biology while Klein is brazenly and outrageously ignorant of even basic economics. The great similarity is that both are fundamentally persons of faith.

Cusack sadly disgraces himself by not knowing any better.
