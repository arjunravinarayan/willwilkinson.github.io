I'm feeling poorly this evening, so please forgive me if my posts are shorter than usual.

If you haven't been checking at my guest spot, I posted early today over Crescat on the question, <a href="http://www.crescatsententia.org/archives/2004_11_17.html#004712">Is Libertarianism Liberal</a>?, inspired by <a href="http://notyourtv.blogspot.com/2004_11_14_notyourtv_archive.html#110063476031996893">this John Phillips post</a>.
