This is both awesomely flattering and weird. From David Brooks:
<blockquote>Among the many dark tidings for American conservatism, there is one genuine bright spot. Over the past five years, a group of young and unpredictable rightward-leaning writers has emerged on the scene.

These writers came of age as official conservatism slipped into decrepitude. Most of them were dismayed by what the Republican Party had become under Tom DeLay and seemed put off by the shock-jock rhetorical style of Ann Coulter. As a result, most have the conviction — which was rare in earlier generations — that something is fundamentally wrong with the right, and it needs to be fixed.

Moreover, most of these writers did not rise through the official channels of the conservative or libertarian establishments. By and large, they didn’t do the internships or take part in the young leader programs that were designed to replenish “the movement.” Instead, they found their voices while blogging. The new technology allowed them to create a new sort of career path and test out opinions without much adult supervision.

As a consequence, they are heterodox and hard to label. These writers grew up reading conservative classics — Burke, Hayek, Smith, C.S. Lewis — but have now splayed off in all sorts of quirky ideological directions.

There are dozens of writers I could put in this group, but I’d certainly mention Yuval Levin, Daniel Larison, Will Wilkinson, Julian Sanchez, James Poulos, Megan McArdle, Matt Continetti and, though he’s a tad older, Ramesh Ponnuru.</blockquote>
First, thank you David Brooks, I think. (I fear a David Brooks endorsement won't do wonders for my liberaltarian cred, but what can you do?) Second, fact-checking: Megan and I (born two days apart) are a full year and a half older than Ramesh. The difference is that Ramesh is married with children and Megan and I are Wii-playing adultescents. Third, a bit of nuance: I was employed by the Institute for Humane Studies for three years, actively working on specifically libertarian "movement" building programs, and they gave me some money for grad studies. But I'd have to say I benefited more by helping to run those programs than by taking part in them. That said, it's really true that blogging has been my ticket. That's how I met Brink, who invited me to interview at Cato. That's how I met Megan, who led me to the opportunity to blog for the Economist, which very nearly led to a full-time gig there. That's how I met the producer who invited to me to come on Marketplace. So blogging really has been good for me. My sense is that Levin, Continetti, and Ponnuru would be pretty much where they are with out without blogging. I think blogging has been pretty crucial to the rest of us. And I think I'm alone in never having been to an elite university.
