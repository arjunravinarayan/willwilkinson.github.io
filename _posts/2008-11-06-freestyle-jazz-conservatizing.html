Oh my. <a href="http://culture11.com/blogs/postmodernconservative/2008/11/06/weighing-in-on-happiness-by-talking-about-suffering/">Helen Rittelmeyer</a>:
<blockquote>For the record, I think the Tocqueville point is mostly valid: "well-meaning matieralism" <em>does</em> yield a world "which will not corrupt the soul but noiselessly unbend its springs of action." But that’s not why I think it’s important to have a theological understanding of suffering floating around our political vocabulary. There’s really only one defensible reason why I care ("the will to badass" being an indefensible reason), which is that I think the redemptive power of suffering is a fact about the world; it’s <em>just true</em>.</blockquote>
I don't want to be mean to Ms. Rittelmeyer, because I don't want her to like it. But the standards for determining what's <em>just true</em> here are... elusive. The Tocqueville point is provably false. Wealthier, happier people are more creative and productive. Springs of action are unbent by depression and the demoralization of poverty. I know, I know. Booooring. But it is, as they say, just true. However, there is no second guessing the redemptive power of making things up.
