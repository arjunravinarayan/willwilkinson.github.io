Although we were not dominant in competition Team Jazz Hands was dominant in spirit (sprit <em>fingers</em>!) at the <a href="http://dcnationalrps.com/">DC National Rock, Paper, Scissors tournament</a>. Jazz Hands member (and beloved housemate), Kelly, is featured prominently, if not exactly by name, in the Washington Post's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45495-2004Aug29.html">excellent coverage</a> of the DC National RPS Championships (but why is this not in the <em>Sports</em> section?). Follow the link. Look at the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/admin/article/largerphoto?contentId=A45495-2004Aug29&thisnode=print/style&showSky=false&imgId=I45472-2004Aug29">picture</a>. The boa! Jazz Hands <em>represent</em>! And check this:

<blockquote>Right now the men of DC Gambit are too busy for a formal interview because they are screaming insults at a possible opponent: a tiny woman in a black tank top and tight jeans, brandishing a cigarette and Yuengling beer, wearing a pink feather boa. She is yelling at them about what wimps they are, how they can't possibly out-RPS her and her friends.</blockquote>

Sure, it's cute, but you don't have to live with the tiny, insult-screaming woman.

It must be mentioned that Jazz Hands member, Ryan "T2" Nunn made the finals, and made us all damn proud.

And behold this awesomeness:
