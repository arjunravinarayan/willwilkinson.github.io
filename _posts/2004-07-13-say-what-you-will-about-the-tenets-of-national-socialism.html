<img alt="nihilism.jpg" src="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archives/images/nihilism.jpg" width="118" height="77" border="0" class="floatimgleft"/>Crispin Sartwell's <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-sartwell13jul13,1,1332930.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">LA Times op-ed</a> in praise of political nihilism is simply wonderful. I have seen nothing that so aptly captures my feelings about the contemporary political scene. Here excerpted are my favorite pithy planks of the nihilist platform:

<blockquote> Abortion — We are the only party that dares to oppose both life and choice. Life is an infestation, choice an illusion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Drugs — A great nihilist heroine, Nancy Reagan, once said "Just Say No." No.</blockquote>

And <a href="http://bmwmoto.free.fr/lebowski/3_nihilists_large.jpg">one more</a> link for you, just because.
