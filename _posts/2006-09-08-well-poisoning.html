<p>I can discern no point of the <em>NY Times </em>article, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/business/08walmart.html?hp&amp;ex=1157774400&amp;en=041baae8b7d41cc1&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">Wal-Mart Finds an Ally in Conservatives</a>" than to not-so-subtly suggest that right wing think tanks are corporate shills whose scholars&nbsp;nefariously omit&nbsp;to disclose&nbsp;Walton Family Foundation funding to hide the fact of their intellectual corruption. Of course, the story doesn't say this right out, and almost, kind of, denies it.&nbsp;But there would seem to be no other reason to even&nbsp;write the story. The upshot seemed to be that there is something shady in not disclosing in op-eds and articles that your organization has received funding from an organization whose interests you are defending, even if&nbsp;the author has no idea who funds their organization.&nbsp;</p> <p>So maybe the <em>Times </em>will take its own advice, and the next time they write <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/business/28wages.html?ei=5070&amp;en=2cba59573314b3e7&amp;ex=1157860800&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1157728150-Byop/Eem7q4Alis8x7qYvg">a front page story</a> that approvingly quotes an&nbsp;Economic Policy Institute scholar on the lack of worker bargaining power, they'll&nbsp;see fit to mention that <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/board">EPI's board</a> is controlled by officials from&nbsp;Big Labor,&nbsp;and that they receive big chunks of cash annually from unions. </p> <p>[ADDENDUM: Oh! And they do mention in EPI in the Wal-Mart article, noting $2.5 mil in union funding just last year. But they should have mentioned that when they were&nbsp;giving&nbsp;EPI a platform&nbsp;to frame the wage statistics.&nbsp;And, anyway, they&nbsp;then allow the fact that Unions are dropping money like crazy to finance&nbsp;attacks on Wal-Mart&nbsp;to be framed&nbsp;by <em>an actual union shill:</em> </p> <blockquote> <p>In response, Chris Kofinis, communications director for <a href="http://WakeUpWalmart.com">WakeUpWalmart.com</a>, an arm of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_food_and_commercial_workers_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org">United Food and Commercial Workers Union</a> that gives money to liberal research groups, said: "While we openly support the mission of economic justice, Wal-Mart and the Waltons put on a smiley face, hide the truth, all while supporting right-wing causes who are paid to defend Wal-Mart’s exploitative practices.”</p></blockquote> <p>Oh! So the money ladled out by unions is in support of economic justice, as opposed to exploitative practices. So no worries!]</p> <p>Or maybe they'll&nbsp;accept that money more often follows opinion than the reverse, and that the merits of an argument&nbsp;generally have&nbsp;nothing to do with the motivation&nbsp;behind making it. I'm currently writing something on the Chicago's idiotic big box ordinance. That I would think&nbsp;this kind of&nbsp;thing is idiotic&nbsp;is not irrelevant to the fact Cato decided to hire&nbsp;me. Does Cato get Walton money? I have no idea,&nbsp;though I hope so. From Target's foundation? I don't know. From the people behind Home Depot? No idea! Is the <em>Times </em>really saying that it is better for me to know than to not know?&nbsp;I'd think the fact that I&nbsp;probably <em>own</em>&nbsp; a piece of Wal-Mart through the mutual funds in&nbsp;my 401K would be more relevant. But I don't&nbsp;know about that, either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
