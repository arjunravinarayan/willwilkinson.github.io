Maybe you've heard about the BMJ study that says that happiness wends its way through social networks? Justin Wolfers says:
<blockquote>The <a href="http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/dynamic_spread_of_happiness.pdf">study</a>, by <strong>James Fowler</strong> and <strong>Nicholas Christakis</strong>, concludes that happiness is contagious within social networks.

According to the authors, your happiness depends on the happiness of your friends, and their friends, and their friends. It’s a fascinating finding, and it was duly reported by <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=fowler%20AND%20christakis%20AND%20happiness&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn">hundreds of newspapers</a>. Indeed, according to Fowler, “if your friend’s friend’s friend becomes happy, that has a bigger impact on you being happy than putting an extra $5,000 in your pocket.”

Unfortunately, it’s probably not true.</blockquote>
