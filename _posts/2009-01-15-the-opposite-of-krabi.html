It is currently -17 degrees here in Iowa. Here is what we have to look forward to... This is the National Weather Service shouting, not me....
<blockquote>
<p class="alNarrative">DANGEROUS TO LIFE THREATENING WIND CHILLS OF 30 TO 50 BELOW WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING. ACTUAL TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL RISE TO BETWEEN 5 BELOW AND 10 BELOW ZERO. TONIGHT... LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE BETWEEN 20 BELOW AND 30 BELOW ZERO. EVEN WITH LIGHT WINDS... WIND CHILLS AT THESE TEMPERATURES WILL EASILY DROP INTO THE DANGER CATEGORY.</p>
<p class="alNarrative">A WIND CHILL WARNING MEANS A COMBINATION OF BITTERLY COLD AIR AND WIND WILL CREATE DANGEROUSLY LOW WIND CHILL VALUES. THIS MAY RESULT IN FROST BITE... HYPOTHERMIA OR EVEN DEATH IF PRECAUTIONS ARE NOT TAKEN. IF YOU MUST VENTURE OUTDOORS... DRESS APPROPRIATELY IN LAYERS COVERING EXPOSED SKIN. FROSTBITE ON EXPOSED SKIN WILL OCCUR IN AS FEW AS 10 MINUTES IN THESE CONDITIONS.</p>
<p class="alNarrative">Â </p>
<p class="alSynopsis">DANGEROUS TO LIFE THREATENING WIND CHILLS THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...</p>
<p class="alSynopsis">ARCTIC COLD WILL CONTINUE TO SETTLE ACROSS THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT. HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL ONLY REACH THE SINGLE DIGITS BELOW ZERO. LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE FROM 10 BELOW TO 28 BELOW ZERO. THESE TEMPERATURES... WHEN COMBINED WITH WINDS FROM 10 TO 20 MPH... WILL PRODUCE DANGEROUS AND LIFE THREATENING WIND CHILLS OF 30 BELOW TO NEAR 50 BELOW ZERO.</p>

<p class="alSynopsis">I prefer this...</p>
