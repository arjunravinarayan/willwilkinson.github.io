My first read was a skim. There are so many idiotic mistakes on each page that it's hard not to give up. I'm reading more thoroughly this time, and I'm struck by the number of points at which I agree with her. No, Friedman was not a student of Hayek's. (I think she says this twice! Frank Knight gets no love.) No, the idea that shocks to the system create opportunities for political change is not a special insight of Friedman's, nor a special strategy of advocates of free markets. No, Milton Friedman was not the inspiration for the neo-Cons (wrong Chicago guy!) and the Iraq war. No, Milton Friedman was not behind what Jeff Sachs, Andrei Shleifer, and company did in the ex-Communist states. It's blazingly obvious that she doesn't know what she's talking about, or doesn't care.

But hey! I'm against the neo-Cons, the Iraq war, and all the inevitably corrupt private-sector contracting that went on. <em>Because I am a Hayekian </em>I don't think much of big plans of to fundamentally remake society, like in Iraq. And <em>because I am a Hayekian</em>, I think the odds of Sachs-style "shock therapy" are very bad. I was persuaded by David Ellerman (who is for my money the smartest and most persuasive guy with broadly Naomi Klein-style "economic democracy" politics) that many firms in communist regimes had already evolved schemes of de facto property rights among existing workers and managment, and that it was a huge mistake to pretend these schemes of defacto rights didn't exist, and to blow them up, just because the guys from Cambridge, Mass thought they knew better, and because many of the people with de facto ownership rights were Communist Party apparatchiks.Â 

Here is Ellerman saying what Naomi Klein would say if she knew what she was talking about:
<blockquote>
<div>Intellectual historians ... will see how little neoclassical economists understood the critique of Bolshevism-Jacobinism by the conservative or "Austrian" tradition of Hayek, Popper, and Edmund Burke. So many of our best and brightest economists seem to have just thought the Bolsheviks had the wrond textbooks. With the right textbooks in their briefcases, the market bolsheviks thought they could fly into socialist countries and use a peaceful version of Bolshevik methods to make the opposite transition.</div>
<div>[WW: I'm sure Ellerman doesn't think Burke was Austrian. Should read "... by the conservative tradition of Edmund Burke or the "Austrian" tradition of Hayek and Popper."]</div></blockquote>
Klein dislikes many IMF and World Bank attempts to simply impose institutions, and <a href="http://www.the-dissident.com/globalization.shtml">so do I</a>. I don't think people ought to be tortured!
