First the smoking idiocy, now <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com/matt91g.htm">this</a>! These freaks in Montgomery County are making me glad to live in rather less chi chi Prince Georges County (for a change). If you can set the cops on your neighbor because you don't like the odor coming from their place, can't we in PG County do something about the odious smells coming from MoCo?
