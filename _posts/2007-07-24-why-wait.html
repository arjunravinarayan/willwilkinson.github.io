Dude! What are you doing? Medics USA on the corner of 17th and P Streets NW. The office will not be featured in <em>Architectural Digest</em>, but the doctors have presciption pads. I've always gotten in the same or next day. <span class="contactInfo"></span><span class="phone">(202) 483-4400. You're welcome.</span>
