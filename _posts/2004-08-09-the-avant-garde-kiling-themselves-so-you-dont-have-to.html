Grant McCracken's interesting post on "<a href="http://www.cultureby.com/trilogy/archives/000164.html">Cultural Innovation: The Benefits and Costs</a>" reminds me a great deal of <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archives/2002/03/the_benefits_an.html">this post</a> of mine from a couple years ago. Grant links to the weird and disturbing <a href="http://franconia.to/reunion2000/memoriam.htm">Memorial List</a> of alumae of Franconia College, an experimental college from the 60s & 70s. But check out Grant's post first to get the context.
