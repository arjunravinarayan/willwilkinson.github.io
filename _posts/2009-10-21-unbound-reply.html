Thanks to professors Kenworthy, Nye, and Anderson for such thoughtful, challenging replies to my initial contribution. I could spend days responding in detail to each essay, but I’d rather have a

Kenworthy on The Value of Savings

I have agued that consumption is a better proxy for material welfare than income and that the consumption gap has widened much less than income gap, if it has widened at all. So, I conclude, inequality in material welfare has not increased much. Kenworthy argues that I’m overlooking the value of accumulated wealth. Money in the bank, he says, widens our horizon of opportunity and these opportunities are valuable to us even if we do not take advantage of them. I agree entirely. But I still believe that, among standard economic measures,consumption is the best indicator of  individual’s or household’s real standard of living.

What are we trying to measure?

He writes:
<blockquote>Suppose … that the very rich have been consuming relatively little of their additional income. Should we then conclude that the economic inequality we care about hasn’t risen much? No. The fact that income isn’t spent doesn’t render it irrelevant.</blockquote>
