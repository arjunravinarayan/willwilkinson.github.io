It's a sad, sad day when the Republicans move me to link approvingly to a <a href="http://www.moveon.org/pac/news/fire.html">Move On fundraiser</a>. This one's to support Democrat opponents of vulnerable Republicans who voted for the FMA. To my mind, voting to write narrowly illiberal convictions into a liberal constitution is sufficient grounds for losing office. I know nothing about the candidates Move On is fighting against other than that they deserve to lose, but that's enough.
