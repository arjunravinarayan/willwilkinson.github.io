One night at the dinner of a small academic conference in Washington, DC, I asked a distinguished philosopher from the University of Texas, then Leiter's colleague, what opinions of Leiter prevailed in his department. He said something along of lines of "Half of us sort of tolerate him. The other half would like to have him drawn and quartered." It's puzzling why this guy, who is obsessed with reputation, continues to destroy his own. He must know how thoroughly he hated.
