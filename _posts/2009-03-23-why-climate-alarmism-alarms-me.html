He's not talking about climate alarmism in particular, but Matt Ridley (in an interview with Ron Bailey I finally got around to reading) <a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/130848.html">states my own view nicely</a>:
<blockquote>What the precautionary principle [the idea that when science has not yet determined whether a new product or process is safe, the government should prohibit or restrict its use] misses is the danger that in not progressing you might miss out on future improvements in living standards for poor people in Africa. I’m desperately hoping to persuade the world, not that everything’s going to be fine, but that there’s a chance everything’s going to be better for everybody and that we should be very careful not to cut ourselves off from that chance.</blockquote>
Cheap energy is a main source of prosperity. The effort to make the cheapest sources of energy more expensive is, in effect, an effort to ensure that more people are made to suffer longer in poverty. Energy Secretary <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123733297926563315.html">Stephen Chu's openness to using tarrifs</a> against countries like China as a "weapon" in the effort to achieve global climate policy coordination illustrates the clear and present danger climate alarmism poses to the welfare of the world's poor. I'm simply unwilling to trade certain immediate harm to vulnerable people in exchange for extremely uncertain future benefits.
