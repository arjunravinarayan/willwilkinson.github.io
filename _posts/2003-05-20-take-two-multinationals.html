-- Ram Ahluwalia <a href="http://www.postpolitics.com/blogs/archives/000471.html#000471">has the lowdown</a> on a new NBER study that reveals--SURPRISE!--that folks who work for multinationals in less developed countries do better than folks who don't work for multinationals in less developed countries. Ram's pulled out the most interesting figures. Good ammo in the sweatshop wars.
