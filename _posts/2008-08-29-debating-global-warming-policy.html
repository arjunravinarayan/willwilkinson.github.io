The conversation of <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/archives/august-2008-keeping-our-cool-what-to-do-about-global-warming/">what to do about global warming</a> is winding down over at <em>Cato Unbound</em>. I've found the discussion fascinating, and I learned a lot. I'd like to see a lot more discussions like this one about climate change policy, and I hope we set a decent example. There were some mildly raised voices, sure. But there's also been a whole lot of data and scientific and economic reasoning exchanged. I guarantee that if you <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/archives/august-2008-keeping-our-cool-what-to-do-about-global-warming/">read through all the essays and replies</a>, you'll learn something.
