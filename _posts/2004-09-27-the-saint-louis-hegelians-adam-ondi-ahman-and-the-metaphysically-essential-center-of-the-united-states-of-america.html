Matt is <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2004/09/real_america.html">whining </a> about the implication that the Northeast isn't "real" America. I can't imagine why he's so defensive about it. He's so wrong that he should just quietly let it go. The core of real America is, of course, Missouri, and I can prove it. A mile from Missouri is a mile from the the essence of America and the fate of the human experiment.

The argument from Mormonism and St. Louis Hegelianism together provide irrefutable support for the proposition that the Show Me State is the quiddity of America.

This simply has to change. The thrust of Hegelianism from the STL is basically that the these United States are in fact the culmination of history. Who can doubt it? Hegel got the logic right but the time and place wrong. One of the STL Hegelians even provided a complicated dialectical proof that St. Louis is destined by the logic of history to be the greatest city of all the world! Understanding that that the east coast of America still gazed longingly across the Atlantic and would never fully slough off the political and cultural logic of the Old World, the STL Hegelians campaigned to move the capital of the US into the next phase of history and the "next great city of the world."

Here's a taste:

<blockquote>During the Civil War, Harris and Brokmeyer [the leading STL Hegelians] had come to believe that the conflict was properly understood in much the same way that Hegel understood the French Revolution. Sectional tensions had come to a head, they believed, because abolitionists and slaveowners both appealed to the abstract, transcendent rights of the individual. Both groups conceived of the individual as existing over and against society. Abolitionists had argued that slaves had an inalienable right to freedom; Southerners defended slave ownership on the grounds that their property rights were sacred and inviolable. In Hegelian terms, both parties asserted merely formal morality, thus indicating that American Sittlichkeit, or concrete morality, was inadequate to the issue at hand. There was no common sense of morality adequate to the resolution of the conflict between abolitionists and slaveowners. Ultimately, Snider was also convinced of this analysis of the war, and developed it at length in several books. Harris’s and Snider’s activities in public education after the war, and Brokmeyer’s involvement in politics, were efforts to promote the formation of a progressive American Sittlichkeit in which moral and political disputes could be resolved without violence. The St. Louis Hegelians’ Journal of Speculative Philosophy was a key part of their efforts to reform society. Though the JSP is often characterized as the first journal in the English language devoted to philosophy; it was in fact equally devoted to the study of art and religion because the St. Louis Hegelians believed those subjects were the paths to Bildung and the formation of Sittlichkeit.</blockquote>

Isn't that awesome! If guys like that say St. Louis is the culmination of the American experiment, and the capital of the End of History, then I say they must be right!

Second, my birthplace, Independence, Missouri, just a jaunt across the state on I-70 is, according to Joseph Smith, the prophetic founder of the one truly and essentially American major world religion, the <a href="http://www.utlm.org/onlineresources/gardenofeden.htm">site of the Garden of Eden</a> and the second coming of Christ.

<blockquote>Latter-day Saints know, through modern revelation, that the Garden of Eden was on the North American continent and that Adam and Eve began their conquest of the earth in the upper part of what is now the state of Missouri. It seems very probable that the children of our first earthly parents moved down along the fertile, pleasant lands of the Mississippi valley." (John A. Widtsoe, Evidences and Reconciliations, three volumes in one, Salt Lake City: Bookcraft 1960, p. 127)</blockquote>

More significant is the fact that America is the true promised land, and New Jerusalem sits in Jackson County, Missouri. Christ will return here first to receive the keys to heaven on earth from Adam. (<a href="http://www.mormonheritage.com/photos1.htm">Click here</a> and scroll down to "Valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman". Also check out the the RLDS Temple just above.) This is the purpose and destiny of America.

Now, it cannot be mere coincidence that two profound strains of American thought place the End of History in Missouri, at the same latitude, on the banks of a mighty river.

As someone born near the site of the second coming, who saved quarters as a child to <a href="http://www.f-stop.com/rlds.htm">rear a temple</a> there in accord with God's commands, and who was raised amid the Iowa corn on the truth about America, and especially Missouri, as the cradle of humanity and God's promised land, I must say (as, I should mention, a small measure of Sioux blood courses through my veins) that city fancy boys like Matt know nothing of America. Any real American knows that New Yorkers are merely nominal Americans, and that that exotic, obscene Babelian city might as well be in Roumania so distant is it, both spiritually and geographically, from the deepest truths about America.
