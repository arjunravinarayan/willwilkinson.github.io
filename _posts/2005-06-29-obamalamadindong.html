I have a <a href="http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=8372">new piece</a> up at the American Spectator criticizing Barack Obama for smearing the ideals of the Ownership Society as "Social Darwinism."  Includes a riff on social solidarity and cooperative market order from my <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3940">Cato paper</a>.
