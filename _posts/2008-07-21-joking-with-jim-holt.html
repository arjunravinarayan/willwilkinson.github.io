In this week's Free Will, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/12720">I chat with Jim Holt</a> about his new book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393066738?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0393066738&amp;adid=0RV1T3F5DJD1MZM421QS&amp;">Stop Me If You Heard This: A History and Philosophy of Jokes</a>. </em>Jim's book was a lot of fun, and so was our talk. Here's the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/books/review/Grimes-t.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">not exactly stellar review in yesterday's </a><em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/20/books/review/Grimes-t.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">New York Times Book Review</a>, </em>but I liked this book because it made me laugh, think, and I read it in a half-hour.
