FORMER Ayn Rand acolyte Alan Greenspan shared an idea for reducing income inequality recently in a Democracy Now! radio interview. At 39 minutes into the chat session, the ex-Fed chief can be heard to say:
<blockquote>We ought to be opening up our borders to skilled labour from all parts of the world because if we were to do that we would increase the supply of skilled workers that our schools have been unable to create and as a consequence of that we would lower the average wage of skills and reduce the degree of income inequality in this country.</blockquote>
One suspects that Mr Greenspan is, reasonably enough, more focused on the productivity effects of a greater supply of skilled labour than on inequality. But he is right, a policy of welcoming more skilled foreign workers, in addition to being a good idea in its own right, would dampen one of the primary causes of increasing inequality: the increasing wage premium for highly-trained workers.

The reaction of leftwing pundit David Sirota is revealing:
<blockquote>Greenspan's solution to economic inequality in America is to drive down the wages of the dwindling number of good-paying jobs that remain, by importing more foreign workers who have no basic rights to bargain for good wages, and who are thus <a href="http://www.cis.org/articles/2005/back1305.html">paid much less</a> than American workers in the same jobs.

Alan Greenspan: One of the truly great class warriors of his time.</blockquote>
Mr Sirota's "progressive" nationalism is somewhat jarring. One imagines Indian engineers, say, are clamouring for work visas because the wages American firms offer are very good indeed compared to their alternatives. Moreover, Indian engineers as a class no doubt have a lower level of economic well-being than most working-class Americans. So who's the warrior fighting on behalf of the less priveleged class? Mr Sirota's impulse to reinforce what is perhaps the central mechanism of rising inequality by restricting the supply of skilled labour rather is an impulse to reinforce rising inequality.

It is therefore clear that Mr Sirota is little concerned with inequality as such, either domestically or internationally -- at least in the short run. He is instead concerned with enhancing bargaining power for domestic workers. Perhaps he believes that a successful re-unionization effort will work to reduce inequality.
