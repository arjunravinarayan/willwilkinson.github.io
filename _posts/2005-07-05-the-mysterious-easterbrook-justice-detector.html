From Gregg Easterbrook's <em>The Progress Paradox</em>:

<blockquote>Considering taxes, a person working full-time at the federal minimum would have to spend and <em>entire days wages</em> to buy a $7 Au Bon Pain sandwich combo for lunch each business week. This simply is not right.</blockquote>

I assume he means "each <em>day of the</em> business week." Anyway, what a weird thing to say! $7 is a hell of a lot to spend each day for lunch. Not considering taxes that's $35 a week, $140 a month, $1680 a year. Is it a baseline of justice that the daily $7 lunch be within reach of each and every one of us. $140 a month is a reasonable monthly food budget including breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My guess is that you can easily make a better than Au Bon Pain quality combo at home for way less than $3 a day. Should you be able to do it on $1.50? $.25? Where (oh where!) can one purchase an Easterbrook economic rightness-o-meter?

What else? A person working full-time at the median wage would have to spend an entire week's wages eating every work day at the Outback Steakhouse, <em>and that's simply not right</em>? Could be? But how do you tell!?
