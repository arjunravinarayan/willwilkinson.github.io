Why is it that some conservatives get hung up on the idea that certain forms of behavior are "unnatural" and thus to be stamped out with extreme prejudice, but will, in the same breath, praise to the heavens our peculiar form of extended market-based social organization, which is as artificial and "unnatural" as one could like? If you want to put your anti-buggery together with cave-living, then, well, that's OK by me. But  if "unnatural" is an objection, then it applies to almost all the benefits of modern life.
