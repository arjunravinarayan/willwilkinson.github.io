MLB's extortion efforts seem to be falling apart here in the district! Jim Henley is your go-to man for reliable libertarian baseball analysis. <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/archives/016434.php#016434">Here</a>. <a href="http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2004_12_12.html#005726">Here</a>. <a href="http://www.highclearing.com/archivesuo/week_2004_12_12.html#005727">Here</a>.

For Carol Schwartz fans, here this tidbit from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/16/sports/baseball/16stadium.html?th">the NYT</a>:

<blockquote>"I can just picture the baseball owners high-fiving each other until they collapsed from exhaustion" after reaching their deal with Mr. Williams, said Councilwoman Carol Schwartz.</blockquote>

Well, you showed 'em Carol. Good work.

I admit it: I will be pretty disappointed if baseball stays away. But if it's a choice between successful extortion or baseball staying away, that's easy.

[UPDATE: A very <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=caple_jim&id=1947248">reasonable column</a> from Jim Caple at ESPN. I'm truly disgusted by the way sports journos and radio guys insist on doing their macho routine 24/7 and then go into a spurned welfare queen hissy when the subsidies for their adolescent hobbies don't come through. It's a really, really sad example of concentrated benefits/diffuse cost logic. So good for you Jim Caple!]
