If you're tired of reading about happiness, maybe you'd like to hear me talk about it. Here's <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/counterpoint/stories/2007/1904564.htm">my appearance on Counterpoint</a> for ABC National Radio (that's Australia) with presenter Michael Duffy, and <a href="http://www.cato.org/dailypodcast/willwilkinson_areyouhappynow_20070420.mp3">my latest Cato podcast</a> with Anastasia Uglova.

If you're not tired of reading about happiness, here are my contributions to the current <a href="http://cato-unbound.org"><em>Cato Unbound</em></a> discussion.

These are a bit more polished than my average blog posts. You should, of course, read the whole discussion, which I've personally found very stimulating.
