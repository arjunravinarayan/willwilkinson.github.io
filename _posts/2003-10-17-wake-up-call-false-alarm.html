-- According to the police update <a href="http://www.genehealy.com/archives/008816.php">PJ forwarded to Gene</a>, the gang rape next to the Central Mission was a "false alarm."

If that's true, then I'm damn glad. But then, what's the story? Was the alleged victim, <a href="http://www.newschannel8.net/news/stories/1003/106839.html">Anne Marie</a>, making stuff up? If so, why? I want to know more.
