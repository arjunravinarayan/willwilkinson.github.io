Rachel says Will is sitting pretty. However, <a href="http://alina_stefanescu.typepad.com">I</a> think he looks slightly uncomfortable. Will voted for Badnarik, which means that he technically wasted his vote, but not as painfully as people in Alabama who voted for Kerry wasted their vote. Tonight is depressing-- all the old, decrepit people on TV repeating old decrepit things. Will is right-- "They have nothing else to do except play with the electoral map."
