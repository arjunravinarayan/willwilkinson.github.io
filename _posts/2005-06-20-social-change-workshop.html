I've been at the University of Virginia the last few days helping out with the IHS Social Change Workshop for Grad Students. It's quite nice to not be running the show, and to enjoy it more from the consumer side. As usual, great people, great conversations.

Here are some illustrations of typical phases of the day, below.

After hours in a dorm room, after someone happy on Franzia has bogarted your camera.

Good times!
