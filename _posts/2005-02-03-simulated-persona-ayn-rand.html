<a href="http://www.binarybits.org/archives/2005/02/happy_birthday.html">Tim's</a> link to Andrej Bauer's <a href="http://andrej.com/objectivism/">primer on Objectivism</a> reminded me that the cartoon Rand of our zeitgest dreams was never put to better use than by the astounding artificially intelligent replicated personas of Forum 2000. Here AI Andrej <a href="http://aardvarko.snappyanswers.com/mirrors/xalton.forum2000.org/matrix/forum_hof_answers%3Fkeepcookie=125&lm=1002259717.html">discusses the axiom of identity</a> with AI Ayn. Also try <a href="http://aardvarko.snappyanswers.com/mirrors/xalton.forum2000.org/matrix/forum_hof_answers%3Fkeepcookie=45&lm=1002259717.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://aardvarko.snappyanswers.com/mirrors/xalton.forum2000.org/matrix/forum_hof_answers%3Fkeepcookie=124&lm=1002259717.html">here</a>.

That Reason's so-called <a href="http://www.reason.com/0503/fe.rand.shtml">Rand-O-Rama</a> failed to acknowledge Forum 2000 shows the editorial staff to be so overoccupied with working obscure song lyrics into the titles of blog posts, outsider art, waxing lyrical about New Jersey, and generally kpeping nihilism fresh, that they neglected to touch on the ubiquity of Rand's spirit in the bygone heyday of the information superhighway.
