I love Robin Hanson's <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/09/politics-isnt-a.html">pithy account</a> of signal-centric Hansonism:
<blockquote><em>Food isn't about Nutrition
Clothes aren't about Comfort
Bedrooms aren't about Sleep
Marriage isn't about Romance
Talk isn't about Info
Laughter isn't about Jokes
Charity isn't about Helping
Church isn't about God
Art isn't about Insight
Medicine isn't about Health
Consulting isn't about Advice
School isn't about Learning
Research isn't about Progress
Politics isn't about Policy</em></blockquote>
And blogging isn't about... what?
