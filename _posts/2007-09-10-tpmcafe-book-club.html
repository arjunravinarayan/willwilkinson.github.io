I'll be joining Stephen Moore, Megan McArdle, Ross Douthat, Ezra Klein, Paul Krugman, and Jonathan Chait over at TPMCafe for a discussion of Chait's new book, <em>The Big Con: The True Story of How Washington Got Hoodwinked and Hijacked by Crackpot Economics</em>. Chait's first post is up, and, at a glance, he appears to me to make a number of questionable claims. I think I may chime in later today. Stay tuned.
