If immigration hurts American workers, native Californians would be hurting bad.

California has taken in more immigrants over the past 45 years than any other state. In each decade from 1970 to 2000, California welcomed a throng of new immigrants, mostly from Mexico and Central America, equal to 8% of its population. That's more newcomers than Miami saw (7% of its population) from the infamous Mariel boatlift. Israel and Spain each recently experienced a decade-long spell in which their populations grew 10% and 9% , but they didn't last.  Over the long haul, California is the world champion of immigration.

So have these hordes of new workers hurt the wages and employment prospects of native Californians? According the latest most sophisticated economic analyses, not at all.

Surprised? Surely less-educated native workers took a hit from this surge of unskilled labor! Nope. How about California's working African Americans? Unscathed. New research by Giovanni Peri, a labor economist at the University of California, Davis, shows that the most economically vulnerable native Californians would not have enjoyed higher wages or more plentiful job opportunities had fewer immigrants set foot in the Golden State.

In recent discussion of income inequality, Newsweek's Mickey Kaus proposed cracking down on illegal immigration to help close the wage gap. "Get employers bidding for scarce workers," Mr. Kaus said, "and you'll see incomes rise across the board without the need for government aid programs or tax redistribution." Mr. Peri's work shows why Mr. Kaus is wrong.

If it's impossible to tell low-skilled immigrants and native workers apart--if they have no differences that matter to the labor market--an increase in the supply of immigrant workers does indeed suppress natives' wages and make it harder for them to find jobs.  That's just good ol' supply and demand. But, in fact, native and immigrant workers in California are different in important ways. They are not what economists call "perfect substitutes".

For example, most less-skilled immigrant workers can't speak English as well as natives, and that matters. It means that primarily Spanish-speaking workers will tend flock to manual work, which pushes native Californians toward jobs involving communications tasks in which they have a clear competitive advantage. These jobs, it turns out, tend to pay more than manual labor, and this has kept native wages from falling.  Most importantly, this division of labor between immigrants and natives promotes specialization which in turn boosts overall productivity.

Because native and immigrant workers are to some degree complementary--because higher levels of overall productivity can be achieved through specialization in different tasks--an increase in the supply of immigrant workers can also increase demand for jobs natives do especially well.

<span style="border-collapse: collapse; color: #1f497d; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal;">fallacy to emphasize is that without immigrants there would have been lower supply of workers but also lower demand for natives, if the jobs of immigrants complement, i.e. increase the need for, the jobs of natives. </span>

a lower rate of immigration would not have been a boon to to less-skilled natives. In a parallel-universe California with a lower rate of immigration, there is less labor relative to demand, and this would indeed exert an upward pressure on wages. But because native and immigrant workers are to some degree complementary--because higher levels of overall productivity can be achieved through specialization--a lower rate of immigration also reduces demand for more communicatively-skilled native workers, rsupply of and wages for these jobs. Because the actual supply-side and demand-side effects have been roughly the same size for native workers, they more or less cancel each other out, leaving natives on average unharmed.

<span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">what I show is that had Cali immigration rates been lower, the labor market for natives would not have been tighter, as one would lose some competition, yes, but also one would loose some extra demand for complementary workers (e.g. construction supervisors, taxi dispatchers, cooks) and the two effects are roughly the same size so no significant impact on market tightness for natives </span>

Suppose you think income inequality is out of control. What can we do about it? We can narrow the income gap by raising taxes on the rich to bring the top closer to the bottom. And we can bring the bottom closer to the top by increasing redistribution to the poor. But <em>Newsweek'</em>s Mickey Kaus has other ideas for boosting the bottom: crack down on illegal immigration.

"If you're worried about incomes at the bottom," Mr Kaus writes, "one solution leaps out at you. ... Get employers bidding for scarce workers and you'll see incomes rise across the board without the need for government aid programs or tax redistribution." But

That may seem to make intuitive sense, but the latest
