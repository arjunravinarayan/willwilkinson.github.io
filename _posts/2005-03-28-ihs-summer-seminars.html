Time is running out! If you're a libertarian or libertarian-curious college student with some time on your hands over the summer, you've got to apply for one of the Institute for Humane Studies' <a href="http://www.theihs.org/category.php/23.html?menuid=5">fantastical free summer summer seminars</a>. You'll make new friends! You'll explore WILD new ideas! Face the ultimate contrarian challenge of alienating even those who agree with you!

Seriously, some of the best times in my young life were had at IHS seminars. If you miss the chance, you'll regret it. There is no tired quite like the good tired after a week of friendly heated conversation, little sleep, and copious free beer.
