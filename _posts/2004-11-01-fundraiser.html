Well, Andrew Sullivan ain't got nothin' on me. So far I've raised approximately $150! Thanks y'all. Every cent is deeply appreciated. But I know we can do better! Readers LIKE YOU keep blogs like The Fly Bottle on the air. And we've got only $100 to meet our goal. I know you want a Fly Bottle-rich November, full of comedy, high-drama, and, HEY! Don't forget the Three Tenors! If you call in with a donation of two dollars or more for the next 4 days -- now listen, this is a LIMITED OFFER -- you will receive a unique ONE-OF-A-KIND limerick, haiku, villanelle, sestina, sonnet, couplet, rondeau or other form of improvised poem by Will Wilkinson! Request a subject! Interested in buggery? Death? Imperialism? For a donation of $2, <em>the cost of a cup of overpriced coffee</em>, you can have your very own, never-before-seen poem on the subject of your choice. Already donated? No problem, add two dollars to your donation and receive deep, personalized aesthetic gratification in return. NOT TO MENTION A BLOGORIFIC NOVEMBER LIKE NO OTHER! This offer is too good to pass up. Act now! Hit the Amazon or Pay Pal button to your left, or send a check or money order to 934 Westminster St NW, Washington DC 20001.

We can do it!
