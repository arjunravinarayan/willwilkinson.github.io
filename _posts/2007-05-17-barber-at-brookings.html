Through a weird confluence of events, I will be discussing Benjamin Barber's new book <em>Consumed </em>with Barber and E.J. Dionne at Brookings this afternoon. You may be surprised to discover that I was not impressed with this book. Should be a blast! Come if you have the time. Info is <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/comm/events/20070517.htm">here</a>.
