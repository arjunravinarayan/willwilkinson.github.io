Glad you asked! If you have yet to check out the February issue of <a href="http://cato-unbound.org">Cato Unbound</a>, which asks, "Is 'Old Europe' Doomed?" then now's a great time to catch up. All the formal replies to <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/02/06/theodore-dalrymple/is-old-europe-doomed/">Theodore Dalyrmple's lead essay</a> are in, and the informal conversation has just begun with a response by Dalrymple. (Choice line: "Multiculturalism is not couscous: it is the stoning of adulterers . . .")

Before the free-for-all conversation heats up, take a look at <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/02/08/timothy-b-smith/reply-to-dalrymple/">Timothy B. Smith's careful elucidation</a> of the economic problems of the traditional Western European powers, and the distinction between these and the healthier Scandanavian welfare states. Georgetown's <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/02/10/charles-kupchan/reply-to-dalrymple-2/">Charles Kupchan vigorously dissents</a> from Dalrymple's dour economic diagnosis, but argues that the problem of integrating immigrants may be even more serious than Dalrymple made it out. Last, but far from least, Pulitzer Prize-winner <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/02/12/anne-applebaum/reply-to-dalrymple-3/">Anne Applebaum writes a prescription</a> for what ails Old Europe.

And keep an eye out for details about next month's issue featuring David Schmidtz, Peter Singer, Jacob Hacker, and more on equality.
