I am endlessly amused by <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/commentary/content/printables/050103roco02?print=true">Gore Vidal's claim</a> that the United States exists because Abraham Lincoln had "an early puberty."

Do I care if Lincoln indulged in man-love? Of course I do! It's delicious. However, unlike the Jaffaites, it matter not a bit to me whether or not the rumors are true.
