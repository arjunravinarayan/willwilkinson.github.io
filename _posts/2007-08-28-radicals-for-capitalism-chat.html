Brian Doherty and I <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/video.php?id=375">discuss his book</a> <em>Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement </em>at Bloggingheads TV. It's an incredibly rich book, and there's a lot more I would have liked to have touched on, but you can only do so much in an hour. Enjoy!
