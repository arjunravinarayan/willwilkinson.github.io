You know what? I'm just gonna say it: I'm bored bored bored of John Stewart. The Crossfire thing was the final straw, the shark jumping. He's permanently tainted, and from here on out we can only look forward to the long slide into "Remember when that guy was funny." Sanctimony is death to satire. The last thing I need is the fake news guy thinking he's King Shit protector of the public interest. Yes, Tucker Carlson is a dick. But we all have eyes. Damn, John. You used to be cool.
