<blockquote>BRYAN CAPLAN <a closure_hashCode_="890" target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2007/06/immigration_restrictions_a_sol.cfm">asks</a> why the solution to immigration issues is always the same—kick 'em out, and seal the borders so they can't come back!—even though the alleged problems vary.

Perhaps he is puzzled because his post doesn't mention one of the most common complaints, which boils down to:  "They aren't like us."  They speak a different language.  Their taste in clothing or house colours is tacky.  They play their music at strange hours, their grocery stores smell funny, and their cultural standards about things like queuing and interpersonal communications occasionally lead to ugly rows.

In educated professional circles, this complaint gets short shrift.  And personally, I find it hard to comprehend, perhaps because I grew up in a neighbourhood where a dozen or so ethnicities were pretty thoroughly intermixed.  I find the unrelenting sameness of places like Nantucket more than a little creepy.  But for many people, this is a huge concern, and my sense is that it often underlies the complaints about welfare, jobs, etc.

Are there real cultural externalities from immigration, or is this simply a hangover from an evolutionary era when interlopers who talked funny really were there to take scarce resources that you needed?  I am still mulling this question.</blockquote>
There are many cultural externalities from immigration, and most of them are positive, in my accounting. But I think negative externalities are what the Economist blogger has in mind. Here we run straight into the semi-uselessness of the idea of externalities for assessing this kind of policy. The idea an "externality" has a nice, neutral, sort-of-scientific sound to it, but of course, we're not going to count just any frustrated preference as a negative externality (or at least not as one worth counting). If I don't want anyone else's preferences to satisfied, then my preference is frustrated any time anyone gets what they want. And if I don't want to live next to Jews because I am a bigot, do we give my backward preference the same weight as a perfectly normal Jewish family's desire to move in next to me? No. We don't. Or, if we do, then we ought to be ashamed of ourselves.

Likewise, if it makes me feel uncomfortable to have to hear all the clerks at McDonald's speaking Spanish to one another, or if I'm frustrated by the fact that my kids aren't going to grow up in the same lily white small town that I did, then that's <em>just too bad</em>. The improvement to the immigrants' well-being completely overwhelms native annoyance, surely making natives the least cost avoiders. All they have to do is stop bitching and learn to love pupusas and telenovelas!
