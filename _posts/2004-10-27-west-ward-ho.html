<img alt="cornel west.jpg" src="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archives/images/cornel west.jpg" width="150" height="205" class="floatimgright" border="1"/>My <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/102704G.html">provocatively titled essay</a> about Professor Cornel West and the dangers of "free-market fundamentalism" is up at TCS. Enjoy.

And don't forget to listen to clips of West's "<a href="http://www.cornelwest.com/">Sketches of My Culture</a>," which is a "watershed moment in musical history."
