This is excellent:

Of course, <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/mixed_feelings_1.php">Yglesias is correct</a> and it's not easy to see how the American Revolution was legitimate. I  suspect it wasn't. But if you think it was, then you're pretty clearly committed to the proposition that a violent overthrow of the American government this afternoon would be legitimate. Go for it!

Just so you're tempted to get too swept up in idolotrous Americanism, here's <a href="http://praxeology.net/HS-FC-20.htm">Herbert Spencer</a> and <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2008/03/10/george-kateb/on-patriotism/">George Kateb</a> on patriotism. Also, Muppets, which are irrefutable evidence of the superiority of distinctively American culture.
