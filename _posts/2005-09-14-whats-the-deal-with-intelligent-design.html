<strong>
What’s the deal with Intelligent Design?</strong>

September 14, 2005 | America's Future Foundation

Join us on Wednesday, September 14, for the next AFF Roundtable: “What’s the deal with Intelligent Design?” Our panelists will ask what the debate over Intelligent Design tells us about American politics and culture. Is ID backlash for loss of local control over public schools and secularization of the curriculum? Is it symptomatic of a deepening cultural divide in America? Panelist will be Will Wilkinson of the Cato Institute; Ron Bailey of Reason Magazine; Blake Dvorak of the Washington Times; and Janice Crouse of Concerned Women for America.

The event will take at the Fund for American Studies, 1706 New Hampshire Avenue, NW, near Dupont Circle. Drinks at 6:30; Roundtable begins at 7:00. Roundtables are free for members, $5 for non-members. So join!
