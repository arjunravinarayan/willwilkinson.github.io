My contribution to the <em>Cato Unbound</em> issue on happiness is <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/04/16/will-wilkinson/the-quest-for-a-scientific-politics-of-happiness/">now online</a>.

I appear today on <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/video.php?id=247">Bloggingheads TV</a> with Henry Farrell of Crooked Timber and George Washington University (we know which affiliation is important).

And I was interviewed last night for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn/counterpoint/default.htm">Counterpoint</a> with Michael Duffy on ABC (Australia) Radio. The show plays every Monday. I think my interview was Tuesday morning Down Under, so I guess I'll be on next week.
