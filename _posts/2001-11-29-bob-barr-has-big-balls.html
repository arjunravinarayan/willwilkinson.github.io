<b>Bob Barr has big balls! </b>While most Republicans stand mute as the President cedes new powers to himself and the state and conducts the war like a benevolent despot, Rep. Barr  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A35043-2001Nov29.html">tells it like it is</a> on civil liberties issues.

Barr, unlike many in Congress, at least knows what his job isn't:

<i>Most people up here, Republicans especially, don't like to make waves. They prefer to sit back and go with the flow, or they might not speak out because it might be contrary to what the Republican president wants. But I was not elected to represent the president.</i>
