As Tyler <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2007/10/fun-debates.html">announced last week</a>, <em>The Economist </em>newspaper is importing its series of debates, already a big success in London, to these United States, and in the inaugural U.S. event, Tyler and I will be debating on the negativeÂ  side of the proposition "That <a href="http://www.economist.com/nydebates/index.cfm?key=about">America is failing at the pursuit of happiness</a>" against <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCnikxLfkE&amp;mode=related&amp;search=">economist-to-the-stars</a> Jeffrey Sachs and Penn economist and happiness researcher Betsey Stevenson. <em>The Economist</em>'s executive editor Daniel Franklin will moderate.

Here's the basic details:

Saturday, November 10th
3:00 - 4:30pm
Gotham Hall
<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=1356+Broadway,+New+York,+NY+10018,+USA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=map&amp;ct=title"> 1356 Broadway</a> (@ 36th Street)
New York, NY 10018

It's one of those Oxford-style debates where the audience votes before and after to gauge who was most persuasive.  If you'll be in New York, or can be in New York, and are looking for some rousing live intellectual-on-intellectual action, you can <a href="http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/event/EventListings?pl=economist&amp;orgId=20341">buy your tickets here</a>. I have to admit: I'm a little nervous and a bunch of friendly faces would help. It's the same price as the Decemberists show, but with more famous economists and many fewer songs about sailing vessels.
