On Saturday I attended a Mercatus Center reception at the American Political Science Association in honor of Douglass North's new book, <em>Understanding the Process of Economic Change</em>. Doug is an intellectual hero of mine, and I was delighted to finally get a picture with him.

(You can check out my review of Understanding the Process of Economic Change in the Cato Journal <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj25n1/cj25n1-19.pdf">here</a>. [.pdf])

And, as a bonus, I had to opportunity to get a snap with Elinor and Vincent Ostrom, two more heroes of mine.

If you read and understood everything Doug North and the Ostroms have written (something I certainly haven't done), you would know about as much about the nature of economic and political instutions as anyone alive.
