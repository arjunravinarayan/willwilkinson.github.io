When you put it that way, obviously. Dani Rodrik rightly points out that it is not necessarily the economist's comparative advantage to sort through the entire thicket of normative considerations beneath policy economic disputes. But somebody's got to do it. The problem is, moral and political philosophers tend to be<em> much</em> worse at economics than economists are at moral philosophy. This is so much so that when it comes to the desirability of <em>any </em>economic policy, it is better to trust the average economist. The philosopher is likely to babble completely uselessly about the fair way to divide manna from heaven, as if wealth is just something that is stumbled upon, or to speak boldly but with embarrassing game theoretical naivete about the obligation of wealthy nation states to enter into a treaty to redistribute to poor nation states much of the gains from undersea mining.
<blockquote>In my view anyone doing policy economics has an obligation to learn more about ethics -- much more -- than the guy in the street would know.  Would someone doing experimental economics feel free of the obligation to learn some empirical psychology?  Would someone doing trade feel free of the obligation to learn some trade law, some history, and some political science?  No.  What's the difference?  Economists like to separate the "positive" and "normative" aspects of what they do, but this distinction has not much impressed the moral philosophers who have looked at it nor has it impressed Amartya Sen.  The very decision to use economic tools emphasizes some considerations and excludes others.  The final policy analysis is not just pure prediction but rather it is also an implicit presentation and weighting of both different kinds of information and different values.  So if you are doing policy economics, it is imperative that you think about ethics at a very deep level, and read widely in ethics.  You are doing ethics whether you like it or not!  Furthermore I don't doubt that Dani already has a deeper understanding of ethics than the (<a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2006/03/framing_antifor.html">often very crude</a>) man in the street.</blockquote>
