Since the name of this blog is taken from a Wittgenstein quote, I feel obliged to pass along good Wittgensteiniana. Try <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/firstbook2001/story/0,10486,603100,00.html">this fun excerpt </a>from <i>Wittgenstein's Poker</i> by David Edmonds and John Eidinow. The title refers to a celebrated, and much disputed, confrontation between Wittgenstein and Karl Popper involving a fire poker.
