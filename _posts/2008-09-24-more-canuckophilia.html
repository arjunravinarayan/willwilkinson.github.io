This morning on Marketplace, I <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/09/24/wilkinson/">praise Canada and lament the U.S.'s increasingly pathetic support for freedom</a>.

I've become interested in writing a longer essay on the freest country in the world. That's a deeply ideologically freighted question, and that's part of what interests me. What would it mean for someplace to be freer than another overall? On the account of freedom, and the weighting of various forms of freedom, that I think is most appealing, I guess Canada or New Zealand would take the top spot. I think it is important for Americans to recognize why the U.S. wouldn't. Anyone want to publish that?
