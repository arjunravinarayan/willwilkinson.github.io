<b>Out of the Darkness </b>-- Yes. I disappeared. I hope you have not abandoned me, though I could not blame you. The static blog reeks of death. If you must know, I went into seclusion to study the dark arts of the social and cognitive sciences to unlock the secrets of the social world. You may think to yourself, "Well, I certainly don't feel like a plaything of forces beyond my comprehension." Exactly. Forces beyond your comprehension are... beyond your comprehension! As all good compatibilists know, being a free will is nothing more than feeling like a free will. But every now and again, ask yourself: "Exactly, <i>why</i> do I want to do this?" You will tell yourself a story about yourself. Now... do you really believe it?
