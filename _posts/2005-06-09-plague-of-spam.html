I've been getting drowned in comment spam. So, until I get a better spam solution, I've disabled comments for unregistered folk. For the time being, you'll need to login with TypeKey. (<a href="https://www.typekey.com/t/typekey/register?lang=en-us">Go here to register</a>, if you haven't. It's free). I like to keep my comments as open as possible, so sorry about this. But TypeKey is pretty easy.
