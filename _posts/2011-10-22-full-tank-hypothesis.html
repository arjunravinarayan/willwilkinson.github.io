Please do observe that the deep red U.S. is more flush with self-reported happiness than burnt-orange France, especially if you are Jonah Lehrer of <em>Seed Magazine</em> and write things like this:
<blockquote>If the government was run by behavioral economists, we would worry less about growth in G.D.P. and more about income inequality. (Essentially, we would look a lot more like France...)</blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
My journey through the happiness literature has led me to seriously entertain what I call the "full tank hypothesis," the idea that the average self-reported happiness in liberal market democracies is about as good as it gets. (There is, however, a lot more to happiness than just what we say about it, and there is more to a broader notion of well-being There is little evidence that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationmaster.com/plot/eco_dis_of_fam_inc_gin_ind-distribution-family-income-gini-index/lif_hap_lev_ver_hap-lifestyle-happiness-level-very-happy/flag#details">a smaller Gini coefficient has any positive effect</a>. And <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.eur.nl/fsw/research/veenhoven/Pub2000s/2000b-ab.html">as Ruut Veenhoven reports</a> (with almost palpable disappointment):
<blockquote>Contrary to expectation there appears to be no link between the size of the welfare state and the level of wellbeing within it. In countries with generous social security schemes people are not healthier or happier than in equally affluent countries where the state is less open-handed. Increases or reductions in social security expenditure are not related to a rise or fall in the level of health and happiness either. There also appears to be no connection between the size of state welfare and equality in wellbeing between its citizens. In countries where social security expenditure is high, the dispersion of health and happiness is not smaller than in equally prosperous countries with less public sector spending. Again increases and reductions in social security expenditure are not linked with a rise or fall in equality in health and happiness among citizens.</blockquote>
But it's not as though a lot of redistribution <em>hurts</em>. Look at the map again and check out Sweden. My point is
