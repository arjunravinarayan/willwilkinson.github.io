If you happen to be a subscriber to the <em>Prospect </em>(the British one), you can read <a href="http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=7795">my article</a> on why politicians who say they care about happiness have got to care about economic growth and economic freedom. Otherwise, you can read the first 2.5 paragraphs. I'll let you know if they make it free for non-subscribers.
