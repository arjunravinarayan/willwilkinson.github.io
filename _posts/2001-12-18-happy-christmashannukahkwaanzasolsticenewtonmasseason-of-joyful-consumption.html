<b>Happy Christmas/Hannukah/Kwaanza/Solstice/Newtonmas/Season of Joyful Consumption! </b>-- Like <a href="http://www.mattwelch.com/warblog.html">Matt Welch</a>, I'm off to the Continent for the Holidays. I'll be in Berlin, visiting <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/annapolis2[1].jpg">a good friend</a>. I'm looking forward to Christmas in Vetschau, a little burg east of Berlin and New Year's in Prague. It'll be my first trip out of North America. And it's about time!

I may post once or twice from Berlin in the next week or so. Otherwise The Fly Bottle will be a field of deafening silence.

Have a great time celebrating whatever you celebrate, and may you get more than you deserve!
