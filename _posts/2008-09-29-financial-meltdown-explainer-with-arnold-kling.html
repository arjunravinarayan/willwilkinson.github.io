In <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/14744">this week's Free Will</a>, I get Bernanke classmate and former Freddie Mac and Fed economist Arnold Kling to explain to me how the heck we got in this sorry situation. I learned a ton. Thanks to Arnold, I was able to sound like I knew what I was talking about at a party Saturday night. Now you can too!

[UPDATE: If you are looking at this on your feed reader and you see Jonah Goldberg and Peter Beinart above, I don't know why. It's correct on my blog. So click through to the actual post or to <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/14744">the BHTV page</a>.]
