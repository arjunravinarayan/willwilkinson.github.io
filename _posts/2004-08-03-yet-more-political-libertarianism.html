For TCS readers arriving from Ed Feser's rejoinder to my rejoinder, you can find further discussion of political libertarianism <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archives/2004/07/more_political.html">here</a> and in the comments, <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archives/2004/07/political_liber.html#comments">here</a>.

I expect to have a reply to Feser's latest up later today or tomorrow.
