The Nation's <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090420/hayes">Chris Hayes has written a great story</a> illustrating how Washington and environmental policy work together to create wasteful stupidity. 
<blockquote>Thanks to an obscure tax provision, the United States government stands to pay out as much as $8 billion this year to the ten largest paper companies. And get this: even though the money comes from a transportation bill whose manifest intent was to reduce dependence on fossil fuel, paper mills are adding diesel fuel to a process that requires none in order to qualify for the tax credit. In other words, we are paying the industry--handsomely--to use more fossil fuel. "Which is," as a Goldman Sachs report archly noted, the "opposite of what lawmakers likely had in mind when the tax credit was established."</blockquote>
What happened?! <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090420/hayes">Read the whole thing</a>. It's a terrific example of unintended consequences. Chris says, "I've come to expect that even nobly conceived laws will be manipulated and distorted for private ends. But once in a while I hear a story that gives me the queasy feeling that I'm nowhere near cynical enough."
