I really like Tyler's Tyrone posts, and so in the spirit of unoriginality, I propose to do a few in the same vein. My friend Liam will happily defend any (non-offensive) position that I am known to reject. The first subject mentioned three times wins.

(By the way, if I recall, the literature does not show that defending the "opposite" position makes you more likely to think you could be wrong. What makes you second-guess yourself is when you have to point out and explain the weaknesses in the position you do hold. So if the game was "gore your own ox" then we would take time to carefully explain the holes in our favorite theories, which is different from defending the contrary.)
