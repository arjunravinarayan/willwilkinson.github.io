I wonder how many drivers exceed the speed limit basically whenever they judge that it won't cause anybody any problems. I'd guess, approximately, all of them. Also, there are very clear laws about, say, using turn signals, or using turn signals when parallel parking (do you do this?), or not taking a right hand turn on red lights when it is marked, not double parking, even if you're just going to be one minute while you fetch your latte.Â  And so on. When's the last time you jaywalked? Lunch? People are more or less rational and tend to respond to incentives, and <em>therefore </em>the roads are a zone of patterned lawlessness. We all know what infractions the cops care about---how much over the speed limit is too much over, etc.--- and we tend to respond accordingly. We even tend to internalize and moralize the rules whose expected cost of violation is relatively high. It's more efficient that way. And thus our huffing indignation is easily riled by those who face different incentives and so flout <em>different</em> rules than the ones <em>we</em> flout without reflection.

This morning on my ride to work I coasted through a stop sign in front of a police cruiser that was approaching from the road to my right. I gave a little embarrassed smile and a little wave. She made a little disapproving face and waved back. It's anarchy I tell you. <em>Anarchy</em>! I got to work in four minutes.

Special thanks to commenter theomobiud who officially wins the thread with this dramatic illustration of justice:

Sometimes people just get what's comin' to 'em, I guess. Now, that guy on the shoulder's getting off scott free, but he's pretty obviously a menace to people with engine trouble who might need to pull over. He'll get his.
