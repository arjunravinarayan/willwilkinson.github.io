Over at First Things, political theorist Ralph Hancock shares a strange Strauss-inflected take on Rawls..
<blockquote>Throughout his career Rawls is very consistent on a kind of absolute separation between the public (Justice, political morality) and the private (“comprehensive views,” whether religious or philosophical).  Another way of saying this is that he affirms the absolute priority of the Right to the Good: it must be possible to frame an ethical theory for the public/political realm in complete abstraction from any conception of a good human life.  This is Rawls’ central assertion, and one that must be fundamentally contested.  ... For in attempting to emancipate the question of rights from the question of the good, Rawls in effect dismisses the central questions of the tradition of political philosophy (human nature, the authority of reason vs. that of revelation, the best life and the best city, etc.).</blockquote>
