In an utterly bizarre breakdown of narcissism, I failed to promote myself on my own blog.

Anyway, the oversight is that I failed to mention my piece in TCS the other day, "<a href="http://techcentralstation.com/032505D.html">Insuring Against the Inevitable</a>" on the "don't think about rates of return; social security is <em>insurance</em> canard.

I don't know how this happened, and it won't happen again.
