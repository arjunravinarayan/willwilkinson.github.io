If you're trying to comment here on The Fly Bottle, chances are your comment is getting kicked into MT-Blacklist moderation. I don't know why this is. If this happens to you, don't worry, I'm checking frequently and will approve your comment. The way to get around moderation is to <a href="https://www.typekey.com/t/typekey/register?lang=en-us&v=&need_email=&_return=&">open a Typekey account</a>, which allows my blog (and anyone else with a MovableType blog) to know who you are and automatically OK anything you have to say.
