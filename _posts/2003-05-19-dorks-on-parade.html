-- No doubt if you should know about it, you know about it. But, anyway, Blogorama on Kalorama IV: this Thursday at the Rendevous Lounge (18th and Kalorama NW) at 7:00 or so.

Maybe I should just think of these announcements as a coordination device. Some people don't want to come unless they know enough other will. So I hereby announce that I will be present, in case that is a marginal inducement to your attendance. If you're lucky, you may get invited to my nearby phat new digs for after-party. That is, if you're sufficiently geek-cool (or sufficiently estrogen-sculpted.) Consider it a challenge.
