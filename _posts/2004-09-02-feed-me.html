I've updated the blog to MT 3.1 and installed MT-Blacklist to rid myself of comment and trackback spam. It seems to be working. Good.

Also, you'll notice that I'm trying out Google ads. They're over there on the right. You'll notice that Google has yet to really parse what this blog is about. Dianetics!? But I certainly won't mind if you click  on an ad or two when you come visit, which gives me a few cents. I could conceivably make up to $2.00 a month!

You may have also noticed that I've freshened up the Amazon book ads over on the left. If you're interested in reading what I'm reading, click through, buy a book!

That is all.
