To prevent future crashes. I think most of these are pretty good. Explanations for each principle in<a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5d5aa24e-23a4-11de-996a-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1"> Taleb's FT piece</a>. 
<blockquote>1. <em>What is fragile should break early while it is still small</em>.

2. <em>No socialisation of losses and privatisation of gains</em>.

3. <em>People who were driving a school bus blindfolded (and crashed it) should never be given a new bus</em>.

4. <em>Do not let someone making an “incentive” bonus manage a nuclear plant – or your financial risks</em>.

5. <em>Counter-balance complexity with simplicity</em>.

6. <em>Do not give children sticks of dynamite, even if they come with a warning </em>. 

7. <em>Only Ponzi schemes should depend on confidence. Governments should never need to “restore confidence”.</em>

8. <em>Do not give an addict more drugs if he has withdrawal pains</em>.

9. <em>Citizens should not depend on financial assets or fallible “expert” advice for their retirement</em>.

10. <em id="U2401247897145hmB">Make an omelette with the broken eggs</em>.</blockquote>
