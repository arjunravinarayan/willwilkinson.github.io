For those of you in the greater Washington, DC metropolitan statistical area, I'll be on <a href="http://www.aei.org/events/type.upcoming,eventID.1709,filter.all/event_detail.asp">a panel devoted to the discussion of Arthur Brooks' new book </a><em><a href="http://www.aei.org/events/type.upcoming,eventID.1709,filter.all/event_detail.asp">Gross National Happiness</a>. </em>UVA's Jonathan Haidt and AEI's Sally Satel will also comment. You can register <a href="http://www.aei.org/events/eventID.1709/register.asp">here</a>.
