I'm pleased to see that Brad DeLong has <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000154.html">endorsed the general principles of the President's (still indeterminate) plan for social security reform</a>. DeLong is worried that the President's proposal will turn into some kind of monstrosity, given Bush's record, which is fair enough. It seems that DeLong is basically saying that he would endorse something like personal accounts if only it was proposed by a Democratic president. If he is saying that, it's pretty interesting, given the heated vehemence of his prior attacks on personal accounts and their advocates.
