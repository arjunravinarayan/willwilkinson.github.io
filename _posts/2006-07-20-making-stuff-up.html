So, it turns out that I wasn't crazy when I couldn't find Vanuatu in the World Database of Happiness, because it's not there! <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115331471730311053-7J_LyfSl_p7LwmPvLs5EKE3eWpM_20060818.html?mod=tff_main_tff_top">Carl Bialik at the WSJ has the story</a>. Apparently NEF just made up Vanuatu's life satisfaction number by extrapolation from other countries. But, truly, this competely defeats the purpose of self-reported life satisfaction. There are undoubtedly unique aspects of Vanuatu's culture, economy, climate, character, etc., that would enter into their pattern of self-reports. So it's pretty funny that Vanuatu "wins" in a much-touted index in part due to numbers the authors made up.
