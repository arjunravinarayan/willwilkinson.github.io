The <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2007/09/19/whats-the-frequency-lakoff/">post below</a> is a review essay I wrote for <em>Reason</em> in Fall 2006 loosely related to George Lakoff's <em>Whose Freedom</em> and Geoffrey Nunberg's <em>Talking Right</em>, both books that attempted to explain Republican political dominance as a linguistic and rhetorical phenomenon. The review essay submits psychologist Jonathan Haidt's theory of moral emotion -- specifically his ideas about religious sentiments -- as a better explanation of the Republicans' electoral appeal. Before the piece was published, the 2006 midterm elections intervened, making the question of the psychological mechanisms behind GOP dominance seem pretty moot. I decided not to torture the piece into something less politically irrelevant, so it never ran. But I think there's lots of interesting stuff in there that says a good deal about the psychological differences between conservatives and liberals. And given yesterday's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/science/18mora.html?em&amp;ex=1190347200&amp;en=6df574f0948f0c22&amp;ei=5087%0A">big <em>Times</em> Science Tuesday profile of Haidt</a> and his ideas, it seems like a good time to ride the wave of internet interest in Haidt's truly illuminating work. (And, of course, to prove that I was into it before it was cool.)
