Just after the inauguration Robin Hanson wrote:
<blockquote>We've heard a lot of hyperbole about how Bush was the "Worst. President. Ever." and Obama's inauguration is the most exciting in a half century.  So to avoid future bias, this is a good time to ask yourself: where do you set Obama's bar?  That is, what does Obama have to do for you to consider him a "good" president, or even better than Bush?  It is enough for you that he is (part) black and a Democrat?  Or does he actually have to do something?  Or are those already insurmountable barriers to you? </blockquote>
I talked a bit about this with Eliezer Yodkowsky yesterday while recording a Blogginheads TV segment to air in the next couple days. It turns out that this isn't that easy to do. I don't mean to preempt what I say there, but I've been thinking a bit more about it, and think others should likewise avoid bias in their judgments by setting some criteria for success or failure in advance, and would like to get some help from the commenters. So here's where I am...

The first Obama term will be a success if:

(1) If he leaves the Executive Branch weaker than when he assumed office.

(2) Most American troops are out of Iraq, and no new (unjustified) wars have been begun.

(3)
