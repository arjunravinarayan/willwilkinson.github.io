I have a <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=092706A">longish essay today in TCS Daily</a> on John Cassidy's <em>New Yorker</em> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060918fa_fact">article on neuroeconomics</a>, arguing that neuroeconomics provides no special justification for paternalist policy.Â  My piece will make a lot more sense if you read <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060918fa_fact">Cassidy's article</a> first. So do that.
