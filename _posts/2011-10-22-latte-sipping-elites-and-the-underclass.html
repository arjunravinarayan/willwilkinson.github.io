So for those at the top of the sexual and economic totem poles ..., the ideal is to live like a good sober bourgeois as long as that is the best you can do, and to embrace a life of bohemian adventure when you can afford it.

But to have that escape hatch you need to have a relaxed and permissive approach to divorce, among many other things. That this relaxed and permissive approach may have sharply uneven effects on different slices of the population is, as far as the "latte-sipping elites" in question are concerned, is immaterial. Because the effects are unevenly beneficial for -- you guessed it -- members of the "latte-sipping elites."
