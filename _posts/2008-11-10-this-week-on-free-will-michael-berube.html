This week on Free Will, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/15749">I chat with Michael Berube,</a> author of <em>What's Liberal About the Liberal Arts </em>about the cultural significance of Obama's victory, the student vote, and the liberalizing effects of going to college and otherwise being around people different from you, among other things.

Since I was in Iowa City speaking to Michael in State College, I feel it is appropriate to advertise the fact that on Saturday, a couple days after our chat, the unranked Iowa Hawkeyes defeated the 3rd-ranked Penn State Nittany Lions by a score of 24-23. This strikes me as important.
