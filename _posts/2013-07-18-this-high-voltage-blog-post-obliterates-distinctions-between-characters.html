In the midst of <a href="http://www.newrepublic.com/article/113919/la-review-books-feuds-new-york-over-kushners-flamethrowers#" target="_blank">this account</a> of the notional LARB/NYRB beef around Rachel Kushner’s <em>The Flamethrowers</em>, Marc Tracy writes:

Purely as a reader, I am with Seidel and the <em>NYRB</em>—I stopped reading <em>The Flamethrowers</em> a third of the way through, because I felt that its high-voltage narration obliterated distinctions between characters.

Exactly why I can’t finish anything by Martin Amis! (Kidding. It’s only tough to finish ladybooks.)

Meanwhile, I enjoyed Dan Kois’ subtweeting efforts:

I know what<i> I’m</i> writing on every workshop story next semester!

I’m generally more interested in high-voltage narration than distinctions between characters, but I haven’t actually found Kushner’s narration especially high-voltage–thought it was sort of understated, actually. I’ve stalled because I stall in absolutely everything that doesn’t cater in a hyper-focused way to that day’s whimsical narrow interest. So far, it’s pretty great. Really fresh.
