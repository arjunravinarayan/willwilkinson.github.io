Glen Whitman <a href="http://agoraphilia.blogspot.com/2004/10/reality-based-community-web-buttons.html">has created a button</a> that members of the reality-based community can proudly display on their weblogs and personal interweb pages. But I must register my protest, as black marble and san-serif cyan letters evoke nothing so much as a hyperspace mausoleum, which, if you asks me, rather smacks of unreality. Maybe it's just me. Better would be a picture of a foot kicking a stone.
