<b>Poetry Specials --</b> After <a href="http://nataliesolent.blogspot.com/2002_07_21_nataliesolent_archive.html#79368514">badly insulting</a> my philosophic, yet poetic, soul, Natalie Solent has <a href="http://nataliesolent.blogspot.com/2002_07_21_nataliesolent_archive.html#79404323">made amends</a>, even reprinting one of my good bad poems (I write bad poetry, but it's <i>good</i> bad poetry... I may have once written a bad good poem, but it's hard to tell). Because no one has clamored for more, I'm going to give it to you. Here's <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/afterthoughts/2002_07_01_at#85296784">another good bad poem</a> over on my Afterthoughts page.
