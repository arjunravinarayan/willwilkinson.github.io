Apologies for the non-blogging. I've been pretty busy working on an essay on social security and my talk <a href="http://people.bu.edu/bulibs/conference.html">at BU</a> this weekend.

FYI, there's a <a href="http://juliansanchez.com/notes/archives/2005/04/return_of_blogo.php">Blogorama tonight @ Rendevous</a>. I will be there.
