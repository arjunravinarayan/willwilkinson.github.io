If you're like me, you feel like you should know more about Canadian politics, but never bother to find out, maybe because you suspect that Canadian politics is not very interesting. Well, it's sure interesting <em>now</em>! Our friends in the land of "toques" and "chesterfields" are having a constitutional crisis! Say what? How did that happen? Ace political theorist Jacob Levy -- who is not Canadian, but teaches at McGill in Montreal and grew up in New Hampshire, which is physically near Canada -- <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/16533">explains all</a> with exemplary lucidity.

[Update: In other crazy Canada news, the front page of the Ottawa Citizen online reports: "<a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/Entertainment/Barenaked+Ladies+concerts+postponed/1068989/story.html">Barenaked Ladies concert postponed.</a>" I think it's pretty clear by now that all hell's breaking looseÂ up there. ]
