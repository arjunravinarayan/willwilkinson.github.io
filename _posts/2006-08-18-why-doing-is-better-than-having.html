<a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2006/08/durable_experie.html">Bryan Caplan on Gilbert</a>...
<blockquote>
</blockquote><blockquote>"Money itself doesn't make you happy," [Harvard psychology professor Daniel] Gilbert says. "What can make you happy is what you do with it. There's a lot of data that suggests experiences are better than durable goods."</blockquote>

<blockquote>I'm baffled. Don't many durables <em>provide</em> a flow of experiences? A nice T.V. is the obvious example; a fine stereo system's another. My CD collection is my pride and joy - whenever I worry about being robbed over vacation, my first thought is the sorrow of seeing my CD shelves empty.

I don't share <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2006/06/challenge_to_co.html">Arnold's methodological aversion</a> to happiness research, but this sounds like a very hasty generalization.</blockquote>
Two points. (1) Market egalitarianism. Qualitiative differences between  cheap and expensive consumer goods is almost nil. There is almost no experiential difference between a cheap TV and a "nice" TV. If Deadwood is good on a $2000 plasma screen on HBO, it's 98% as good on your sister's giveaway used 19", a $35 DVD player, and Netflix. The extra expenditure buys almost nothing in terms of the quality of experience. Same with the music. For $4.95 a month, I can get I'm guessing 75% of of Bryan's CD collection on Yahoo. Capitalism makes money worth much less when it comes to manufactured non-positional  goods. (2) Adaptation. The mind is a novelty whore --- a <em>change </em>detector. Consciousness loses its grip on the added quality of a premium picture, sound system, etc., <em>very fast. </em>The cheap, almost perfect substitute for an expensive stereo is a cheap stereo.  The cheap substitute for an exquisite meal at the best restaurant in Paris is... what? IHOP in Arlington? A great memory and a great story <em>is </em>an ongoing flow of positive experience. Gilbert is right.
