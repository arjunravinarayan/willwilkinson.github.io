Apparently MTV is set to <a href="http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20011119/en/television-mtv_1.html">do it's part in the middle east propaganda war</a>. The idea is to spam the 15-30 y/o middle east demo with <a href="http://www.rockthevote.org/index2.html">Rock the Vote</a>-like public service efforts to cast westerners in a favorable light. They've clearly got the wrong idea. MTV is a schizoid basketcase message-wise. Their "very special" socially conscious programming is the worst sort of misinformed, pusillanimous liberalism posing as broad-minded humanism, while the videos (once their <i>raison d'etre</i>) are full of the grossest sort of flesh-peddling bling bling -- which is excellent! Clearly middle eastern Muslims need spiritual liberation, and a gyrating Britney Spears slathered in oil singing "I'm a Slave for You" is rather more liberating than MTV's stylized NPR-lite quasi-politics (although <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/talent/bio_altschul.jhtml">Serena Altschul</a> is... desirable). The Afghans & Arabs don't need after-school specials with Serena's sedated earnesty. They need T&A, thuglife and <a href="http://slipknot.imusiq.com/pics_specials/group/new_group_blue.jpg">Slipknot</a>! They need their MTV2! If they don't know who we be, give 'em DMX!
