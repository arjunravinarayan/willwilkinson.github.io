-- You'll have noticed that I've been rather lax with the blog. Well, I've been busy organizing this year's IHS <a href="http://www.theihs.org/workshop">Social Change Workshop for Graduate Students</a>. I'll be driving down to Charlottesville tomorrow to set things up, and then running the Workshop all next week. Check out the <a href="http://www.theihs.org/article.php/740.html">list of lectures, and seminar and workshop sessions</a>. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a more intellectually stimulating week anywhere. This is where it's happenin', folks.

After that, I'll be sitting in on a <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/socialchange/">Mercatus Center Social Change Project </a>discussion of John Nye's long-awaited manuscript on the War, Wine, and Taxes and the emergence of free-trade in the 19th century (it turns out that France is a better than you think, and England is worse). It has been one of the great luxuries of my short intellectual life to have the opportunity to hang out with Doug North, Barry Weingast, Avner Greif, Joel Mokyr and their ilk at these Mercatus workshops. I'll return in a little over week exhausted, but very, very intellectually satisfied.
