I'm been really grateful for the suprising (to me) amount of attention <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=10351">my inequality paper</a> has gotten. There have been a raft of really thoughtful replies, and I want to give them all the thoughtful responses they deserve. I've been overloaded the past couple of weeks, in part by this daunting task. But I'm going to try to address some of the most notable replies, despite the fact that eons will have passed in blog time by the time I get to all of them. I hope folks won't feel too slighted by my slowness to respond.
