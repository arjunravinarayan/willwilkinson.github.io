Ygelesias, among others, is <a href="http://yglesias.typepad.com/matthew/2005/01/im_friends_with.html">skeptical</a> of the various pro-reform social security calculators. My colleague Tim Lee <a href="http://www.binarybits.org/archives/2005/01/fun_with_number.html">responds</a>.  Here's a bit:

<blockquote>More to the point, <em>even if you grant all of Matt's objections</em>, personal accounts still end up doing better. I whipped up a little <a href="http://www.ringworld.org/~tlee/ss/">calculator</a> of my own, which does the math in a transparent fashion. Cato's calculator says that if I start out at 25,000 at age 25, that I'll end up with a stock portfolio of $406,000 and an annuity of $38,685. My calculator more or less <a href="http://www.ringworld.org/~tlee/ss/?wage=25000&growth=4&fica=6.2&age=25&retirement=67&return=4.97&fica_cap=90000&process=Calculate">duplicates that result</a>. If we grant all of Matt's objections and use a 4.2% rate of return (60% stocks at 5%, 40% bonds at 3%, with let's say a higher .5% transaction cost), then my personal account <a href="http://www.ringworld.org/~tlee/ss/?wage=25000&growth=4&fica=6.2&age=25&retirement=67&return=3.7&fica_cap=87900&process=Calculate">still ends up being worth $310,000</a>. And if we assume the annuity pays out a conservative 7%, instead of Cato's assumption of 9%, I would still end up with an annual benefit of about $22,000. According to Cato's calculator, Social Security would pay $15,748 for the same wage profile.</blockquote>
