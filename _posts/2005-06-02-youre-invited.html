I've helped to put together a little theatrical field trip tonight for the America's Future Foundation's newly recussitated AFF Underground cultural series. There's a couple spots left for discount tickets, and you should email me if you want to come.

We'll be going to theater J at the DC Jewish Community Center to see the award-winning new play Hannah and Martin, by Kate Fodor. Hannah and Martin explores the intellectual and intimate relationship between celebrated philosopher and notorious Nazi, Martin Heidegger, and Hannah Arendt, one of the 20th Century's most incisive theorists and critics of totalitarianism.

After the play, we will convene to Local 16, at the corner of 16th and U Streets for drinks and discussion of what promises to be intellectually provocative play.

Tickets are $25.00, five dollars off the regular price, and a merer $20.00 for AFF Founder's Club members, ten dollars off the regular price. (Why not become a Founder's Club member now?) AFF Underground has a block of only 30 seats, so act fast.

If you would like to claim a ticket, email me at willwilkinson AT gmail DOT com.

Hannah and Martin
Thursday, June 2, 7:30 pm
Theater J, DC Jewish Community Center
1529 16th St NW

"Celebrated professor and philosopher Hannah Arendt is forced to confront charges that her lover and mentor, the venerable Martin Heidegger, is a Nazi sympathizer and must choose whether to indict or
forgive him. A sensual and deeply felt play of ideas that mines questions of forgiveness, academic independence, and the limits of loyalty when blinded by romantic desire."

[UPDATE: AFF's block of tickets at the discounted rate is now spoken for. However, if you're interested in coming and didn't get a discount ticket, you should still feel free to join us. Call the theater for tickets, meet us before in front of the JCC (7:15-ish), and join us for drinks and discussion afterwards at Local 16.]
