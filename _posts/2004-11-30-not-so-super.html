Hi there. I seem to have botched the end of SuperNovember! Sorry about that! There are a multitude of issues on my end of the monitor including my nth cold in two months, weird awful eye strain, unpleasantly large TA duties, and a writing deadline. But if you could just <em>see</em> how adorably charming I am, you'd forgive me. I am, however, pleased to see that The Fly Bottle has remained a venue of vigorous discussion. FYI, I am largely in agreement about whatever you like with the indefatigable Micha Ghertner.
