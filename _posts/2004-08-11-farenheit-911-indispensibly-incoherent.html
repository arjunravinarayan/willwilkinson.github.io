Irfan Khawaja <a href="http://www.solohq.com/Articles/Khawaja/Critical_Reception_The_Meaning_of_Fahrenheit_9-11.shtml">calmly points out the dumbfounding contradictions</a> in the reviews of Michael Moore's latest <em>tour de sophisme</em>. For example:

<blockquote>Todd Gitlin’s review in Open Democracy calls Fahrenheit 9/11 a “shoddy work”: the film’s “sloppy insinuations, emotional blackmail and all–around demagoguery,” he argues, are an affront to one’s “conscience,” and make it the moral equivalent of a beer commercial. The same conscientious concern induces Gitlin to describe Fahrenheit 9/11 somewhat paradoxically as a moral necessity. Meanwhile, he lionizes Moore himself as a “master demagogue.”</blockquote>
