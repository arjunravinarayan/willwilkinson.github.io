I am guest-blogging at the Economist.com's <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/">Free Exchange blog</a> this week. Kerry and I are currently in New York, so posting won't get hot and heavy until tomorrow or Monday, but check it out.

And speaking of check it out, check out Kerry on Thursday's <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/redeye/">Red Eye</a>. (Click the "Hoff the Wagon" and/or "Homesick Blues" clip.) We had drinks with Gutfeld and Levy. Awesome.
