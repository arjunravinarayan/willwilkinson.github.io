-- I don't understand this passage in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54584-2004Apr29.html">the WaPo story</a> about the accession of ex-communist countries to the EU:

 "Fifteen years after the Berlin Wall fell, the eight -- who will join with Cyprus and Malta -- have traded the straitjackets of planned economies and one-party rule for the risky pleasures of democracy and capitalism."

According to my understanding of the way the world works, anything BUT democracy and capitalism is risky, though not a pleasure.
