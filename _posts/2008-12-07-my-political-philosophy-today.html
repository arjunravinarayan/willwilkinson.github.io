A few people have communicated that they don't understand what my political philosophy actually is, so I thought I'd summarize it.

I think of myself as a liberal. Most people think of me as a libertarian. I'm happy to be a libertarian. What <em>I</em> mean by that is someone who favors a maximum of individual liberty, limited government, free markets, and peace. I think of this as the "freestanding" political content of libertarianism. It can be given many different kinds of foundation. The foundations of my libertarianism are almost but not quite conventionally liberal.

I am some kind of contractualist. I have found that many libertarians insist on a dichotomy between "consequentialist" and "deontological" arguments for libertarianism, and have a hard time placing contractualists. Broadly speaking, contractualism is consequentialist.  But the justificatory role of conequences is not aggregative. The idea is that a system of constraints, rules, or rights, is justified if<em>each</em> person subject to these constraints, rules, or rights is likely to fare well under them. So a certain respect for the individual is built in at the methodological level. But the methodological individualism at the heart of contractualism is not meant to reflect a prior commitment to the value or inviolability of the individual. The point is that the problem of finding a best set of rules to live by is a <em>coordination</em> problem, and individuals are the primary unit of coordination. Contractualists are sensitive to the fact that the viability of a set of rules depends on its stability, and that stability is largely a matter of first-personal <em>reasons for compliance.  </em>

but torule or practice utilitarianism will give similar answers as a welfare-oriented contractualism. But I don't assume that welfare is the only possible value. I think of myself as both a consequentialist and a deontologist, so I think there is a problem with this dichotomy.  agree with conventional liberals that political liberty is "merely formal" and does not have "fair value" unless people have sufficient means to exercise their liberty.
