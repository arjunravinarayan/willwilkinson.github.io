Here you go. According to this completely unscientific poll, riddled with selection bias, and featuring a difficult-to-interpret and probably tendentious statement of the question, self-described libertarians prefer a bigger welfare state and no drug prohibition to a smaller one where the drug war rages on. I think the Magic Button question on drug prohibition and Canadian-style health care is probably a fairer interpretation of the spirit of Hood's assertion, so you'll have to wait to see how that came out. We've got 101% since I used a format that allowed participants to tick both boxes, and some did. But here's our results:

<strong>What Libertarians Prefer</strong>

466 responses

A society with a welfare state of size x and drug prohibition.
189 - <strong>41%</strong>

A society with a welfare state of size x+1 and no drug prohibition.
277 - <strong>60%</strong>

<em>People may select more than one checkbox, so percentages may add up to more than 100%.</em>
