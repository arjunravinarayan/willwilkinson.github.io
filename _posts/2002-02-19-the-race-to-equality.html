<b>The Race To Equality</b>  --  Here's <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Columns/Nyegrowth.html">a nice piece</a> by John Nye (an economic historian, not Bill, the science guy) explaining how economic growth diminishes inequality. The upshot is that differences in income hide everything that really matters: the quality of what you can afford. The difference between rich and poor in transportation used to be feet versus carriage. Now, its a 1988 Escort vs. a 2002 BMW, which, despite our keen sense for the social distinction, is in fact a triumph of equality. Read it. You'll get a sense of how all the whining about the income gap masks the amazing egalitarian power of markets and technology.
