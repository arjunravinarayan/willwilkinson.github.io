<b>Picturing the Blogosphere</b> -- The <a href="http://samizdata.blogspot.com/">photo frenzy</a> over at Samizdata inspired me to search my archives for a picture of myself wearing camouflage, shooting automatic weapons, releasing a falcon, or something equally manful. I came up empty handed. Instead, I offer myself at seventeen years wearing a dress and wig in the classic drag farce, <i>Charlie's Aunt</i>.  Real men wear upholstery.
