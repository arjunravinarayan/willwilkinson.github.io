Sorry for the silence. I was off giving a couple talks (one on happiness, one on inequality) at the <a href="http://www.theihs.org/SeminarDetails.aspx?id=1122">IHS Social Change Workshop</a> at Brown. I had the pleasure of hanging with Mike Munger, John Tomasi, Jason Brennan, John Nye, a number of other excellent faculty and about 125 really smart grad students. But now I'm back. With a vengeance!
