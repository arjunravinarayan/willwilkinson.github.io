<b>Living Without Appeal </b>-- Re-reading my previous post, I was reminded of one of <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/afterthoughts/2001_12_01_at#7964438">my favorite philsophical passages</a>. It's from <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, by Albert Camus, and it moves me every time I read it. It's about living "without appeal." Very roughly, Camus' point, as I understand it, is that by remaining almost naively honest about what one truly knows and persistently denying the desire to use doubtful readymade schemes to make life seem meaningful, one might discover a more authentic kind of meaning. But that doesn't do it justice. Go read it.

I've posted it on a new page, <a href="http://willwilkinson.net/flybottle/afterthoughts/">Afterthoughts</a>, where I'll be putting things like like this that supplement writings on the main page.
