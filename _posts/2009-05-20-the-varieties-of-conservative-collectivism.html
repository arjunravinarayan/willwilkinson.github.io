<a href="http://www.theweek.com/article/index/96712/The_rise_of_collectivist_conservatives">In my latest column for The Week</a>, I argue that David Brooks is wrong about the problem with individualism and that self-professed individualists, such as Glenn Beck, are really just as collectivist as Brooks, but with a flag fetish and a penchant for Ye Olde Constitution fonts. I speculate that this has something to do with why the GOP is busted.
