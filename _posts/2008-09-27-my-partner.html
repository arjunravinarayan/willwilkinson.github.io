This phrase presents something of a communication problem, especially with Kerry's androgynous name. "My girlfriend" sounds relatively frivolous, failing to convey the fact of cohabitation and level of commitment. "My live-in lady," as was suggested to me by one DC-area native, is inconsistent with other evident markers of socio-economic status, and therefore conveys irony and/or a lack of respect. I happen to like "my partner" because Kerry and I are...<em> partners</em>. We are a team. Our lives are a life together -- a joint endeavor. It's aggravating that the language has yet to offer terms that communicate this status other than spouse/husband/wife. So far, it's hard to beat POSSLQ. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSSLQ">Here is Wikipedia</a>:
<blockquote><strong>POSSLQ</strong> (pronounced <span class="IPA" title="Pronunciation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"><a class="mw-redirect" title="Help:IPA for English" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English">/ˈpɒsəlkjuː/</a></span>) is abbreviation (or <a class="mw-redirect" title="Acronym" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym">acronym</a>) for "Persons of Opposite Sex Sharing Living Quarters," a term coined in the late 1970s by the <a title="United States Census Bureau" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> as part of an effort to more accurately gauge the prevalence of <a title="Cohabitation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation">cohabitation</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" title="USA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA">American</a> households.

After the <a class="mw-redirect" title="United States Census, 1980" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census,_1980">1980 Census</a>, against all odds, the term gained currency in the wider culture for a time, with <a title="CBS" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS">CBS</a> commentator <a title="Charles Osgood" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Osgood">Charles Osgood</a> memorably composing a verse which began

<dl> <dd><em>There's nothing that I wouldn't do</em></dd> <dd><em>If you would be my POSSLQ</em></dd> <dd><em>You live with me and I with you,</em></dd> <dd><em>And you will be my POSSLQ.</em></dd> <dd><em>I'll be your friend and so much more;</em></dd> </dl> <dd><em>That's what a POSSLQ is for.</em></dd></blockquote>
Sadly, if you insist on talking about "my POSSLQ" it will sounds like you're talking about a passel of possums and a pool cue, or something.
