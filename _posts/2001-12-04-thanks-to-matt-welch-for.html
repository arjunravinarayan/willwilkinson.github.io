Thanks to <a href="http://www.mattwelch.com/warblog.html">Matt Welch </a>for (1) excerpting my comment about Johnny Taliban and thereby creating a happy spike in my traffic, and (2) calling me handsome. Now, if I could only get <a href="http://www.tabloid.net/wedding/B1.html">a hot French wife</a> like Matt's!
