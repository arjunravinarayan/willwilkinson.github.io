So, directly below you'll find the book review that was apparently a little too saucy for <a href="http://affbrainwash.com/">Brainwash</a>, having appeared there from some time Sunday evening to some time Monday morning. Conservative donors and all that, I suppose. (Do take note, if you've ever considered writing for Brainwash.) Please note that the foul, foul language is all Baker's, which I quote purely for critical purposes.

I do think the point I'm attributing to (or reading into) the book is an important one, and worth thinking about, and so I present the review, with minor modifications of the original (which, naturally enough, may be <a href="http://tinyurl.com/69rxs">found in the Google cache</a>) here for your pleasure and edification.
