<b>More on AmeriCorps</b>.<a href="http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=831&FS=Bloating+AmeriCorps"> Fun-filled takedown</a> by  James Bovard on the often acidic<a href="http://www.mises.org/default.asp"> Ludwig von Mises Institute Website</a>. Highlight:

<i>In Buffalo, N.Y., AmeriCorps members helped run a program that gave children $5 for each toy gun they brought in. In Lone Pine, Calif., AmeriCorps members put on a puppet show to warn four-year-olds of the dangers of earthquakes. Elsewhere in California, AmeriCorps members busied themselves foisting unreliable "ultra-low-flush toilets" on poor people. . .

 Lenkowsky [Bush's appointee] told AmeriCorps recruits last month that their "daily duties" will be "helping to thwart terrorism itself. . . . Terrorists sow the seeds of distrust. You sow the seeds of trust, at a time your nation badly needs them." Perhaps Lenkowsky believes that nothing would intimidate Al Qaeda more than a doubling in the number of puppet shows performed in America.</i>

To be honest, <i>I'm</i> scared shitless by puppet shows.
