They keep changing the day on me, but Free Will's up at Bloggingheads TV. This week<a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/11517"> I talk to University of Arizona philosopher Shaun Nichols</a> about his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0195314204?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0195314204&amp;adid=0H496AJ615ZAR29JMXCQ&amp;"><em>Sentimental Rules: On the Natural Foundations of Moral Judgment</em></a>, psychopaths, our intuitions about free will, and  other interesting thing. There is also a book giveaway, which you can still possibly win!
