Sure. If we had fantastic rates of growth, we could zero out the deficit and have huge surpluses in a fairly short amount of time. And we might also make medical discoveries that extend life expectancy 150 years, in which case Social Security would be in REALLY big trouble. (Raise the retirement age to 200?) It's a wash!
