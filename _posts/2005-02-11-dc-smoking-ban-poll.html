DC Ward One Councliman Jim Graham has <a href="http://www.grahamwone.com/">a little poll on his website</a> asking "Should the DC Council act to eliminate smoking in indoor workplaces?" (On the left column, a ways down.) Apparently the anti-freedom forces at Smoke-Free DC already got the word out and they're way ahead in the poll. Will you help? Tell my councilman that DC should not violate the rights of business owners to run their establishments as they choose.
