<a href="http://www.sirc.org/publik/bad_habits.shtml">In Praise of Bad Habits</a> -- Text of fascinating lecture by Peter Marsh, a learned and even moving defense of hedonism and full living against the self-righteous ascetics and the health police. Highly recommended! I'm going outside to smoke a Marlboro!
