It's not too late to <a href="http://www.cato.org/event.php?eventid=5077">register for tomorrow's Cato book forum</a> on <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=9&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fredbluerichpoor.com%2F&amp;ei=x-_HSIz1CZzQMYnsoRQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzbjygPom_0h0JtFtBHQDSF9Uoeg&amp;sig2=H9-T89ApYrbYddgKqBf_zg"><em>Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do</em></a>. Andrew Gelman will be joined by one his co-authors, Boris Shor, with comments from Michael P. McDonald and Brink Lindsey. I'm told C-Span will be recording, so there is some chance that your impressively penetrating question will be televised.
