<b>Progressive Libertarianism</b> -- Peter St. Andre has <a href="http://www.saint-andre.com/blog/">some great thoughts</a> on moral progress and the attitude that distinguishes progressives from paleos. It looks like we've been thinking quite along the same lines. Peter also mentions 'urban libertarianism'. Maybe 'cosmopolitan libertarianism' is better... Hmmm... Cosmopolitan progressive libertarianism. How could you be against that!? I especially like Peter's addendum to the lefty bumper slogan: "If you want peace, work for justice... If you want justice, work for freedom."
