<p>I'm quoted in this morning's LA Times (I think the piece is front page) in <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-happy3jul03,0,7940212.story?coll=la-home-headlines">an article on happiness research</a>. Unfortunately, I am quoted rather <em>exactly</em>, and therefore come off somewhat lacking in gravitas<em>:</em></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Most of the things that have been published about the policy implications of happiness research have definitely had a big-government slant to it. They're like, 'Here's another reason for the government to do something else,' &quot; said Will Wilkinson, a policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I stand by the quote! <em>They</em> are in fact <em>totally like</em> &quot;Here's another reason for the government to do something else.&quot; Ah! The vernacular. Anyway, I really enjoyed chatting with the author Stu Silverstein over the phone. And showing up in an article between Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Richard Easterlin is more than all right by me.Â  </p>
