<p>Economists Andrew Oswald and Andrew Branchflower begin&nbsp;a very interesting <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w12934">new NBER paper</a> [$$$] on the relationship between levels of self-reported happiness and&nbsp;blood levels&nbsp;with this dubious claim:</p> <blockquote> <p>For effective social and economic policies to be designed, it is necessary for policymakers to be able to measure human well-being.</p></blockquote> <p>They better hope they're wrong, because if&nbsp;they're right, then effective social and economic policy <em>cannot be designed</em>! Oh no!&nbsp;  </p><p>Why? Two reasons:  </p><p>(1) Human well-being, as opposed to the several dimensions or components of well-being,&nbsp;is pretty much impossible to measure.  </p><p>Why? Because&nbsp;the specific nature of human well-being is relative to the individual&nbsp;and&nbsp;the components&nbsp;of well-being are&nbsp;diverse and must often be traded against one another.&nbsp;  </p><p>What does this mean? Let's start with the relativity of well-being. The achievement of valued aims (meaningful goals, important personal projects, whatever you'd like to call it) is a component of human well-being if anything is. However, the content of valued aims varies from person to person.&nbsp;It follows pretty straightforwardly that&nbsp;the specific requirements of well-being vary from person to person.  </p><p>(For those of you&nbsp;on the lookout for the scourge of "post-modernist relativism," please note that this&nbsp;kind of "relativism" is in fact a kind of relativism, and is also&nbsp;completely innocuous,&nbsp;entailed by the uncontroversial&nbsp;fact that different people have different personalities, different tastes, and different "callings.")  </p><p>Next,&nbsp;consider the&nbsp;diversity of the components of well-being and the potential conflicts&nbsp;between them.&nbsp;Health and longevity are components of well-being if anything is.&nbsp;But so is the individual achievement of valued aims. Some people's perfectly reasonable aims&nbsp; may be incompatible with maximizing their health and longevity. Imagine&nbsp;a cholesterol-saturated gourmand who would rather die than give up his foie gras,&nbsp;or an adventurer who draws profound meaning&nbsp;from&nbsp;facing down life-threatening challenges.&nbsp;So... how much&nbsp;weight do we give to one component of well-being -- &nbsp;health and longevity, say&nbsp;-- relative to another -- for example, the achievement of&nbsp;valued aims that conflict with maximal&nbsp;health and longevity? The answer is that there is no answer -- no answer science and&nbsp;empirical evidence compels us all to agree on, at any rate.  </p><p>The upshot, then, is that while we can&nbsp;measure various dimensions or components of well-being -- whether it be&nbsp;health and longevity, the experience of pleasure, a sense of self-efficacy and control, the&nbsp;development of basic human&nbsp;capacities, or the achievement of valued aims -- we cannot measure well-being&nbsp;<em>as a whole&nbsp;</em>because&nbsp;Mother Nature has nowhere posted a table of&nbsp;exchange rates between the various values that compose individual welfare.&nbsp;It's simply not&nbsp;out there for&nbsp;the scientist to find.  </p><p>Now, there may be a rough&nbsp;cultural&nbsp;consensus at any time and place about the relative weight to place on competing individual welfare-constituting values. But this consensus, to the extent that there is one,&nbsp;has to be&nbsp;discovered, and changes as time goes by. So, at this point, we're not "measuring well-being"&nbsp;so much as&nbsp;attempting&nbsp;to find&nbsp;some bit of overlap&nbsp;if people's <em>conceptions</em> of well-being. We can use the overlap&nbsp;to base&nbsp;a few general principles of mutually beneficial social interaction almost everyone&nbsp;will&nbsp;be willing to affirm. But the larger and more diverse the society, the smaller and more general the overlap.&nbsp;There&nbsp;are&nbsp;<em>always </em>broad swathes of often heated disagreement<em> </em>in pluralistic societies. And that's what principles and institutions&nbsp;of liberal neutrality&nbsp;are&nbsp;for: to peacefully accommodate the inevitable lack of consensus about&nbsp;questions of value in open, cosmopolitan societies.  </p><p>Would you say that a set of policies were "effective" if it&nbsp;peacefully and stably&nbsp;coordinated the behavior of millions of individuals in pursuit of their valued aims,&nbsp;and constantly increased their&nbsp;capacity to to realize them,&nbsp;despite the&nbsp;fact that there are as many conceptions of well-being as there are people?<em> </em>&nbsp;Would you consider such a set of policies "effective" even if we didn't know how to measure human well-being scientifically?&nbsp;  </p><p>(2) Policymakers have no incentive to accurately measure human well-being --&nbsp;even if it was accurately measurable -- or to&nbsp;appoint, or take counsel from, those who do.  </p><p>Lucky for them,&nbsp;Branchflower and Oswald&nbsp;begin their paper&nbsp;with&nbsp;a monumental&nbsp;falsehood. Their introductory proposition implies, among other things, that effective social and economic policy never has been designed!&nbsp;Their general idea, I take it, is that in order to design something effective, you have to be able to measure "effectiveness." [<em>Edited: Erased gibberish not meant to be publish. Added rest of para, which was meant to be published.</em>] The problem is&nbsp;understanding "well-being maximizing" as equivalent to "effective." The difference between aggregation-obsessed consequentialists and coordination-obsessed consequentialists lies in accepting or rejection that equivalence.&nbsp; </p><p>I think&nbsp;my considerations (1) and (2) imply that not only does effective policy <em>not </em>require that policymakers are able to definitively measure well-being, but that effective policy is <em>much </em>more likely if we&nbsp;fully grasp the indisputable empirical facts that <em>conceptions</em> of well-being&nbsp;(and of "effective") are plural (and this is so whether or not I am right on the philosophical point that the constitution of well-being for each individual requires trade-offs between&nbsp;different dimensions of well-being) and that policymakers are neither scientists nor reliable consumers of science.&nbsp;  </p><p>Maybe it is disappointing to social scientists -- frustrating even! --&nbsp;to&nbsp;face up to the fact&nbsp;that no interest or competence in social science<em> whatsoever</em>&nbsp;is&nbsp;required&nbsp;for&nbsp;a hugely successful career as a policymaker, which is to say, as a politician or bureaucrat. This is even the case in places where social science flourishes most!&nbsp;Disappointing as that fact may be, social scientists may want to take&nbsp;it into account when&nbsp; thinking about the design of effective policy. &nbsp;  </p>
