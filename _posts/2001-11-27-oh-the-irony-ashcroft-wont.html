<b>Oh the irony!</b> Ashcroft <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19159-2001Nov26.html">won't release a list of the detainees </a>because that it would "violate their rights. As Lucas Guttentag, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said (to WashPost):

<i>It is ironic that the government is now concerned about rights when it has arrested and jailed hundreds of people without giving the American public any proof that the detainees are being treated fairly.</i>

Indeed.
