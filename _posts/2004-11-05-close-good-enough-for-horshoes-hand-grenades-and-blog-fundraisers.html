I'm sure you're all waiting with bated breath to learn the the results of The Fly Bottle Cash-for-Content SuperNovember Fundraising Drive! The results are: close enough! I raised something around $230, which was a decisive factor in making this months rent (this kind of scrambling shouldn't be necessary in the coming months, so don't worry, I won't keep asking), and it's a nice affirmation. You like me, you [cough] really like me. So let SuperNovember commence!

Now, if you gave me money as part of some perverse bet that I wouldn't in fact be able to raise $250, then I will happily give you a refund. But if you gave to do your part in the compassionate libertarian fight against homeless libertarian intellectuals, and to get <em>three or more</em> thinkadelic posts per day throughout November, then you will get your wish. The dream is a reality my friends.

Poems are forthcoming. I'm low on verbs, unfortunately, but the shipment of should arrive over the weekend.
