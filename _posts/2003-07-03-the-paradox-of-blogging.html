-- It turns out that the more your life is worth blogging about, the less time you have to blog.

Things have been pretty interesting while I've been MIA. Just for instance, on Saturday I spent a couple hours in a car driving Douglass North to D.C., talking about the problems with the prevailing wisdom in economics, cognition, and international development. And I just got back from the Tombs, where a bunch of us drank, smoked, and chatted with Hitchens for a couple hours.  But the best of it is that my friends, who have been congregating frequently at Westminster, are hardly an intellectual letdown from Nobel Prize winners and the Orwell of our age. So, it's a good life.
