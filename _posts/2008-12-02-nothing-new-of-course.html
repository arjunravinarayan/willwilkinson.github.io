Yet I suspect Milton Friedman did more to end the draft than the accomodating Baez sisters, which I guess suggests something about the relative persuasiveness of certain organs. 

The excruciatingly pedantic former logic instructor in me cannot resist pointing out that this is a <em>rather </em>stronger (and more ridiculous) claim than "I only sleep with Democrats," as it sets out a sufficient condition for <em>girls</em> saying yes, rather than a mere necessary condition for <em>a girl </em>saying yes. But it is also pointlessly weak, if it is given a not implausible interpretation as "For every boy who says no, there is <em>some </em>girl who says yes." (Don't think you're getting Joan Baez!) But this follows trivially from the truth that "For every boy, there is some girl who says yes" -- especially if money is involved. But there's no denying it's a damn pithy slogan!
