So, I have to move out of my house tomorrow. But I still have some perfectly good stuff that I need to get rid of. It's ALL FREE!!! If you're a DC area denizen, who would be able to drop by my house this evening, and you want something, drop me a line. I have pictures of some of this things, if you're interested. I have:

* A 5' four drawer file cabinet

* A medium/large American Tourister suitcase with wheels and telescoping handle.

* An old but powerful Hoover canister vacuum cleaner, complete with free bags.

* A couple sets of plates. Mix & match!

* Some nice pots.

* Several electric fans.

Dibs goes to Fly Bottle readers. But act soon, before I wave this red meat at the Craigslist scavengers!
