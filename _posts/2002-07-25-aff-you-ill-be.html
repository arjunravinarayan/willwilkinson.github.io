<b>AFF You! --</b> I'll be going to the America's Future Foundation monthly <a href="http://www.americasfuture.org/viewEvent.cfm?calendar_id=330&calendardate=7">happy hour</a> at the 18th St Lounge this evening. I have a soft spot for AFF's monthly event; I met my sweetheart there. <a href="http://www.americasfuture.org/affpics/HH6-27-02/pages/P1010038.htm">Here I am</a> (on the left) at the last one, underdressed and unshaven, as usual.  (And try <a href="http://www.americasfuture.org/affpics/HH6-27-02/pages/P1010027.htm">here</a> (center-right) for <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/notes.html">Julian</a> in his mafia/pimp outfit, along with <a href="http://www.theihs.org/tab4/torrance.html">Kelly</a>, Juan Carlos, and some tall dude.)
