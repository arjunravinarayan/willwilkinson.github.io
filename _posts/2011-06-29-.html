By June 2008, when all the primaries and caucuses were finished, the two had basically split <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/democratic_vote_count.html">the Democratic vote</a>. On the Republican side, Rudy Giuliani had a 10-point or greater lead over John McCain in the national polls, while Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee were both polling less than 10 percent each. <a href="http://www.thegreenpapers.com/P08/R.phtml">When it was all said and done</a>, McCain won 47 percent of the vote, Romney and Huckabee both won a touch more than 20 percent, and Giulianiâ€¦won just 3 percent!
