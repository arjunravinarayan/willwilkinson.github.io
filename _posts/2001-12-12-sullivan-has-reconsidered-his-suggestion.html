<a href="http://www.andrewsullivan.com/">Sullivan has reconsidered</a> his suggestion that  Johhny Taliban springs from the corrupt mores of those blue Gore-voting states. But he does so not because the suggestion is full-on stupid, but because Mr. Walker is in fact a right-wing extremist. In the end Sullivan holds fast,  reasoning that the only authentic rebellion against liberal permissiveness is illiberal authoritarianism. He concludes:

<i>... the link between his chosen lifestyle and the culture in which he was born is still valid, I think.</i>

The link is <i>what</i>, Andrew? That the culture in which he was born didn't flat out prohibit Walker's eventual choices? As Daschle might put it, I'm disappointed in Andrew's sloppy thinking. Walker is <i>one guy</i>. He is not a representative sample of Marin County. I know the first rule of punditry is to make wild generalizations on the basis of your own experience, and I guess it carries over naturally to wild generalizations on the basis of some other guy's experience. But hasty generalization remains a canonical fallacy.

I know folks with permissive parents from permissive places who are conservative/liberal activists (take your pick). I know folks with strict parents from conservative places who are themselves permissive/strict (take your pick). So what! Sullivan's misplaced eagerness to use Walker as a bludgeon against "permissiveness,"  liberalism, and bluehood is mystifying.

I guess when you see cracks in the walls of hegemony, you beat at them with anything you can grab.
