The link to <a href="http://www.affbrainwash.com/archives/015607.php">my review</a> of <em>Checkpoint</em> mysteriously disappeared from the Brainwash <a href="http://www.affbrainwash.com/">front page</a>. And a bit later, mention of the review disappeared from the graphic at the top. I'm puzzled. What's going on? I'm trying to find out, but no word yet.

[UPDATE: It's now totally gone. Well, it <em>is</em> an Orwell-themed website.]

[UPDATE TO THE UPDATE: Well, upon a few moments reflection, I now feel like I don't really know what's going on. So I'm going to retract what I just said and wait until I get a better sense of what happened.]
