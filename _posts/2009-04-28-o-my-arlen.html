My quick take is that this sucks, because the more choke points in the policymaking process the better. That said, it probably doesn't change all that much unless Senate Dems can muster reliable intraparty unanimity. A few things that wouldn't have passed will, and those could be an important few things, but most final votes won't be different. The one way this hurts the Dems is that it makes a narrative of GOP obstruction less plausible, and if various things go south by the mid-terms, the Republicans can more plausibly say that all of it's the other guy's fault.
