Mild error about Clinton's record of peace aside, Chris Rock is obviously a better grade of celebrity. Via the bethrothed, <a href="http://kerryhowley.com/2009/01/20/what-chris-rock-said/">who is more incisive than even Chris Rock when she writes</a>:
<blockquote>This would be a better country if the new administrator of our public goods jurisdiction were ushered into office with all the fanfare of a shift change at Target.

That said, I’d like to appoint Chris Rock Official Enumerator of the President’s Responsibilities:
<blockquote><strong>CNN:</strong> What are you hoping Barack Obama does for this country? What do you think is his most important task?

<strong>Rock:</strong> You know, if you’re the president you only have two jobs: peace and money. That’s it. I mean, it’s like, what did Clinton do? We were at peace and we had a budget surplus. That’s it. That’s the gig. The closer you get us to those two goals, you know, that’s pretty much the gig. Is that too much to ask for?</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Too much because too little.
