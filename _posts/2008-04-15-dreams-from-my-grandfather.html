A while back, on a lark, I googled my maternal grandfather, Leo Draveling. Because sports archivists are weirdly thorough, I found more than I was expecting. Best of all, I found pictures. Folks, here's the 1930 Michigan Wolverines:

<a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/i/image/getimage-idx?viewid=1;cc=bhl;entryid=x-bl001049;quality=3;view=image"><img src="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/bl001049_bhl.JPG" alt="" /></a>

He's number 37, second row (seated in chairs), second from the left. (Click for a bigger pic.) They went 8-0-1, tying Northwestern for the conference championship.

According to <a href="http://141.211.39.65/allroster/FMPro?-DB=allrost.fp5&amp;-Format=fbresult.htm&amp;-SortField=name&amp;-SortOrder=Ascend&amp;year=1930&amp;-max=170&amp;-Find">the roster</a>, he was a tackle, and the second heaviest guy on the team at 208 lbs. Apparently he wrestled heavyweight for Michigan in the <a href="http://www.ncaawrestlingtournament.com/pdf/brackets/NCAA%201929.pdf">2nd NCAA tournament</a> in 1929. He didn't place. He <a href="http://www.armchairgm.com/Leo_Draveling">played in the NFL</a> for one year with the Cincinnati Reds. I had no idea his nickname was "Firpo."

Never met the man. He died when my mom was a teenager. He was apparently something of a brute and not entirely admirable. Roots mean somewhat less for me than for most people. That about a quarter of my genes are his makes his story part of mine only in a small causal sense. If this minimum of significance becomes meaningful or deep,  then it is because I choose to make up a story about myself in which it plays that role. I don't. My junior high English teacher (or the sum total of things I have eaten, for that matter) have more to do with what I am.  That said, it is definitely interesting to vainly pick out the points of physical resemblance. I lament the cleft chin that might have been.  And I find that, looking at my strapping grandfather, I am happy to believe that I possess a latent store of powerful athleticism. That hopeful and self-flattering interpretation of the chancy genetic facts will be useful, and to me entirely justified, if I am thereby moved to join a gym and reveal my inner All-American before I do come to weigh more than a tackle for the Michigan Wolverines.
