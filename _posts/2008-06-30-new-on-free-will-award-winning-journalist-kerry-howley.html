On Saturday, after several disastrous attempts, Kerry and I suceeded (sort of) in <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/12357">recording a new diavlog</a>. We talk mainly about her latest Reason cover on fertility panics, but also about the tyranny of old people, and scrapbooking. Botched ending makes it special!

I'm insanely recording three this week. They are: Robin Hanson on Hansonism, Bruce Caldwell on Hayek, and Jim Holt on jokes. What would you like me to ask them?
