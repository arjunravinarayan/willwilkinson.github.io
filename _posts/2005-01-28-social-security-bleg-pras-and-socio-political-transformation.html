Please cite by email or comments the best "bigthink" magazine and journal articles about social security reform. I'm especially interested in pieces that explore that claim that PRA's, by creating a class of "worker capitalists," will have a transformative effect on the economy, politics, society, and so forth. This is in my opinions the most interesting argument about PRA's, but I'm not seeing anything that pays close attention to the claim, or attempts to substantiate it in detail. Please let me know if I'm missing something!
