<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/opinion/09friedman.html">Thomas Friedman's <em>New York Times </em>column</a> today would be astonishing in its incoherence if only Friedman hadn't long ago sapped us of our ability to be astonished by his incoherence. Like many capital-'d' Democrats, Friedman has soured on democracy for failing to deliver on his policy wish list.
<blockquote>Watching both the health care and climate/energy debates in Congress, it is hard not to draw the following conclusion: There is only one thing worse than one-party autocracy, and that is one-party democracy, which is what we have in America today.</blockquote>
Why does Friedman say the United States has one-party democracy? Because the Republican Party is effectively opposing the Democratic Party's agenda! Not even kidding. Get this:
<blockquote>The fact is, on both the energy/climate legislation and health care legislation, only the Democrats are really playing. With a few notable exceptions, the Republican Party is standing, arms folded and saying “no.” Many of them just want President Obama to fail. Such a waste. Mr. Obama is not a socialist; he’s a centrist. But if he’s forced to depend entirely on his own party to pass legislation, he will be whipsawed by its different factions.</blockquote>
Only the Democrats are really playing! You might think that would mean they can do whatever they darn well please. But no! The Democrats can't do anything! Because the <em>other party</em>'s opposition is so effective! So it's exactly as if there's just one party: nothing gets done!

My hunch is that the <em>Times' </em>editors see Friedman aiming the gun at his foot, but watching a man stupid enough to actually pull the trigger is so fun they hate to intervene. That or they're trying to explode the myth of American meritocracy.

So where were we? Oh, yes: one-party democracy is aggravating because sometimes one party can't do what it wants because the other party gets in the way. Sooo frustrating!!! Why have democracy at all when all you end up with is a single party stymied by the other one! And so it is that Friedman comes to wax romantic about communist central planning:
<blockquote>One-party autocracy certainly has its drawbacks. But when it is led by a reasonably enlightened group of people, as China is today, it can also have great advantages. That one party can just impose the politically difficult but critically important policies needed to move a society forward in the 21st century. It is not an accident that China is committed to overtaking us in electric cars, solar power, energy efficiency, batteries, nuclear power and wind power.</blockquote>
Nikita Kruschev, the enlightened leader of a now-defunct one-party autocracy, was also committed to overtaking the United States in technology and so much more. "We will bury you" is how he put it. At the time, more than a few left-leaning American opinionmakers suspected he was right. After all, how can inefficiently squabbling democracies possibly keep pace with undivided regimes wholly devoted to scientifically centrally planning their way into the brighter, better future? And that, children, is why we speak Russian today.
