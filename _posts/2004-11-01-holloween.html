So, despite the fact I had a nice time in Quebec City, I'm bitterly disappointed that I missed Halloween this year. Missy's <a href="http://listenmissy.com/Halloween_2004.html">page of pictures of my peoples</a> made me pretty sad I missed it. And hey Missy: the girl whose name you forget because of the alcohol is Christine.
