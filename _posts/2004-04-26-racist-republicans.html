-- Googling <a href="http://www.theihs.org/socialchange">Social Change Workshop</a> faculty member Gerard Alexander for his email address, I ran across his recent review piece in the Claremont Review of Books on the<a href="http://www.claremont.org/writings/crb/spring2004/alexander.html">The Myth of the Racist Republicans</a>. It's a careful demolition of a persistent piece of conventional wisdom. Before this came out, I ran into Gerard in the politics section of Idle Times books in Adams Morgan and we had a fun conversation on this topic as he was searching out some of the books he discusses in the piece. Do check it out.
