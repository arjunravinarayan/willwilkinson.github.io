This month's Cato Unbound on the prospects of radical vs. Fabian libertarianism (more or less) has churned up some unusually churlish commentary. Peter Thiel's contribution in particular, in which he (rather wrongly, in my opinion) attributes the infeasibility of "democratic capitalism" in part to women's suffrage, has sparked a good bit of mocking outrage. Here's <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2009/04/28/secession/">Michal Lind mostly being dense at Salon</a>. Here's Owen Thomas at <a href="http://gawker.com/5231390/">Valleywag</a> (not a place I thought I'd find Cato Unbound mentioned.) Even <a href="http://www.feministing.com/archives/015103.html">Feministing</a>! My colleague Jason Kuznicki, who organized and edited this issue of Unbound, <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2009/04/29/cato-unbound-update/#more-6948">has a good response to all this at Cato@Liberty</a>. And when I have a bit more time, I'm going to write a post defending the desirability of liberal democracy, and the possibility of democratic capitalism (even with women voters!), against Thiel and Friedman's radicalist pessimism.
