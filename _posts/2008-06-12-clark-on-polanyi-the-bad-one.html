Greg Clark's <a href="http://www.nysun.com/arts/reconsiderations-the-great-transformation-by-karl/79250/"><em>NY Sun</em> takedown of Karl Polanyi's <em>The Great Transformation</em></a> is ripping good fun. <a href="http://www.longviewinstitute.org/nosuchthing">This response</a>, by a sociologist, is entertaining for other reasons. For example, I like how it starts out strong by pointing out that  Sun is a neocon rag. The commenters at Mark Thoma's, from whence comes the link, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/06/polanyis-the-gr.html#more">are aghast</a> at Clark's lack of reverence for the wrong Polanyi. Anyway, I want more new reviews of sixty year-old books!
