In a post today at the New York Times' Economix blog, Nancy Folbre, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, fingers globalization—that is, the allegedly "borderless" character of our economy—as the culprit behind the jobless recovery. In addition to the usual liberal nostalgia for mid-century corporatism, Ms Folbre pines for the restoration of solidaristic economic nationalism:

During the 25 years after World War II, the interests of American investors and workers were closely, though not perfectly, aligned. Productivity increases were passed on in the form of higher wages that, in turn, fueled increasing demand for domestically produced goods and services.

Businesses willingly paid taxes to support public programs designed to improve the education, health and security of the labor force on which they relied.

Back in 1953, Charlie Wilson, the chief executive of General Motors, famously expressed the opinion (often slightly misquoted) that what was good for the country was good for General Motors, and vice versa. I doubt that was entirely true then, but it was certainly more true then than it is today.

Large corporations are no less patriotic now than they were then. But their economic incentives have changed. Facing intensified international competition, they have little reason to care about the nationality of their workers, consumers or investors.

Ms Folbre notes that the increase in global interconnectivity and economic competition has produced, among other benefits, "higher living standards for many workers in developing countries". But then she illustrates the suspect moral mathematics economic nationalism.

But however significant these benefits, the other side of the ledger reveals significant costs arising from political realignment and efforts to escape regulation and taxes.

Jobless growth is only one symptom of increased social conflict, intensified economic inequality and weakened democracy. The prosperity in jobless prosperity exists only for the rich.
