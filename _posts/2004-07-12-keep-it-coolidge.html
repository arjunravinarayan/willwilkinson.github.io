Every time I wear my "Keep it Coolidge" t-shirt, admirers of Silent Cal implore me to reveal where I purchased such a fine wearable testament to one of <a href="http://www.fee.org/vnews.php?nid=4279">our greatest presidents</a>. It's <a href="http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=4309&itemType=PRODUCT&RS=1&keyword=coolidge">Urban Outfitters</a>, who have a somewhat questionable grasp of the idea of a "Founding Father."

I wore "Keep it Coolidge" to the beach on Independence Day, because the colors was representing. Little did I know that it was also Cal's birthday! I hope, unlike me, you reserved a moment of silence to honor our perhaps least loquacious and meddlesome President.
