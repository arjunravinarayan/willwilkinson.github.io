-- Judging from this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/18/fashion/18WONK.html?ex=1397620800&en=f58640baa2cb15f6&ei=5007&partner=USERLAND">NYT Fashion & Style piece</a>, Ana Marie Cox is all the rage. (Nice dog!) I just want to point out that the Gray Lady failed to note my attendance at the Peter Bergen party. (I was the guy in the burlap thong.) And for that matter, they missed, Matt "Baby" Yglesias (who is, thanks to AMC, "famous for DC.")
