I AM reading MIT behavioural economist Dan Ariely's new book "Predictably Irrational", and I had to stop to write a blog post, lest I blow a gasket. The book is chock full of fascinating experiments that reveal how people make choices followed by dazzling non sequiturs and frankly embarrassing cultural and political commentary. The scientific quality is high. The philosophical quality, very low.

This unevenness is on display early. A book about rationality requires a clear idea of the concept. According to Mr Ariely rationality is "the simple and compelling idea that we are capable of making the right decisions for ourselves." Well, that's novel. It would be quite helpful if Mr Ariely offered some insight as to what he is going to count as the "right decision", but he does not, which gives him a good deal of unearned flexibility in discussing irrationality.

This is related to what may be the fallacy at the root of a great deal of behavioural economics. If the point is to show that the traditional formal model of rationality is descriptively inadequate, then the field is a stunning success. It's true: talking mammals are not much like the homo economicus of the textbooks. But so much success in proving that we are world's apart from  homo economicus should tip us off that homo economicus is not a good benchmark for rationality. According to the theologians, angels have no mass. We embodied beings are not therefore obese.

The behavioural economist cannot show us that a conception of rationality is nonsense, and then straightaway appeal to it as a legitimate ideal, against we fall woefully short. A sensible normative conception of rationality is based on the best we can do, given our numerous limitations. Provided such a sensible standard of rational choice, many (most?) of Ariely's examples of putative irrationality vanish. For example, how is it irrational for preferences to be sensitive to context when there is no way for beings likes us could form them context-free? That it is possible to manipulate preferences by manipulating context in many cases is fun but has no clear upshot. Seldom do these examples spotlight a failing; they shows how we work, even at our best.

Mr Ariely's questionable intellectual judgment is usually on full display at the ends of his chapters. For example, in his second chapter, after using cute experiments to question the general validity of the law of demand, we find this:
<blockquote>If we can't rely on the market forces of supply and demand to set optimal market prices, and we can't count on free-market mechanisms to help us maximize our utility, then we may need to look elsewhere... If you accept the premise that market forces and free markets will not always regulate markets for the best, then you may find yourself among those who believe that the government (we hope a reasonable and thoughtful government) must play a larger role in regulating some market activities, even if it limits free enterprise.</blockquote>
I find this flabbergasting. Every indication is given by Mr Ariely that these alleged irrationalities are general tendencies of the species. So they must afflict every voter, every politician, every bureaucrat. How exactly is "a larger role" for the government supposed to improve on the coordinating function of the price mechanism? We are told nothing at all. I suppose we just hope, as Mr Ariely does, that "reasonable and thoughtful" people come to power. Needless to say, this is not social science.
Even more flabbergasting is the end of the chapter on the distinction between market norms and social norms. (E.g., don't offer to pay your mother for dinner; sometimes you can get people to do more by not paying them, etc.) Here Ariely comes across as something like an <em>anti-economist</em>. After suggesting that we could get armed customs agents to wreak more violent havoc on drug traffickers by puffing them up with "honor", Mr Ariely goes on to posit that the problem with education in America is that it is <em>too </em>bound up in market norms! The solution is... more hope:
<blockquote>Instead of focusing the attention of the teachers, parents, and kids on test scores, salaries, and competition, it might be better to instill in all of us a sense of purpose, mission, and pride and education.</blockquote>
Oh! Well, thanks for that. But how? In an earlier passage he says, "That would take some inspirational leadership, but it could be done."

We can take either of two lessons away from this: (1) President Barack Obama will have the power to extract us from what once naively seemed like intractable misalignments of interests with his astonishing power to instill "purpose, mission, and pride" in the general populace.  (2) Once you've crushed the law of demand, and then the power of market incentives, policy analysis is reduced to useless exhortations to inspirational leadership.
