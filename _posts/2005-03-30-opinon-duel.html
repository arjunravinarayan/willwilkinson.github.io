The New Republic and The National Review are hosting an "<a href="http://www.opinionduel.com/">Opinion Duel</a>" between Jonathan Chait and Jonah Goldberg. I'm quite pleased to see that Jonah has availed himself of <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archives/2005/02/jonathan_chait_1.html">my post</a> criticizing <a href="http://tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050228&s=chait022805">Chait's silly empiricism article</a>, which, naturally, makes the first round a blowout in Jonah's favor.

Now, if I can whip up an anti-Goldberg screed and get <em>Chait</em> to link to it, I would consider that a libertarian triumph.
