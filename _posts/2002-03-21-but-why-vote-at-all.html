<b>But Why Vote At All?</b> -- I should mention that I don't vote. First, the state is a system of institutionalized violence and exploitation, and I don't care for the idea of endorsing it by directly participating in the political process. Second, my vote doesn't matter. Third, no candidate ever espouses my values to a degree that would merit casting a vote as an exercise in identity affirmation. So, why do <i>you</i> vote?
