<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2009/03/pouring-biofuel-fire">Mother Jones on heavily subsidized biofuels</a>:
<div id="biofuel_left">
<blockquote>Food prices have risen 130% since 2002. The World Bank estimates that up to 75% of the increase is due to demand for biofuels.

Clearing grasslands to plant biofuel crops releases 93 times as much greenhouse gas as will be saved by the fuels grown on the land each year. Destroying Indonesian peat bogs releases 420 times as much.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There were food riots in at least 30 countries in the past 2 years. More than 40 people were killed when Cameroonians protested rising prices.

The US government spent $9.2 billion on ethanol subsidies in 2008. It spent $1.5 billion on food aid.</blockquote>
But now we've got better people and won't destroy the environment and cause food riots this time! Right?</div>
