Tim Graham of the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/04_01_18_corner-archive.asp#023059">NRO Corner</a> get's it right. Take note all you Mid-Atlantic ninnies.

<em>UM...IT'S IOWA. [Tim Graham]
Dumbest moment of the morning came on NPR, when Juan Williams was asked if the around-zero cold would keep Iowans home from the caucuses. This is IOWA, people. They're USED to these temps in the winter. Twenty below zero, that's a factor. But they aren't holding the caucuses outside...</em>

A twenty below Iowans will begin to get firm with you about wearing a hat.
