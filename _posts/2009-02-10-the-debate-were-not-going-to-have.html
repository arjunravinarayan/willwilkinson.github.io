So true. The "OH MY GOD WE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE FROM RECESSION MONSTER" rush to pass the deficit spending package is a travesty of democracy because we could really use a serious national debate on the value of various forms of public spending. But that was summarily preempted. This bill is a transparent vehicle for an immense amount of new public spending, much of which will have no effect other than to benefit certain political constituncies and make most of us poorer. I find the debate over what kinds of government spending are and are not conducive to broad prosperity <em>really interesting</em>. It's too bad we couldn't have passed a responsible <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/testimony/2009/0127_budget_rivlin.aspx?emc=lm&amp;m=221840&amp;l=40&amp;v=9">Rivlinesque</a> stimulus bill, leaving open the possibility of increasing the value of public sector activities by better identifying which of those activities actually have value. But when a political party has a chance to pay off their hungry clients after years of famine, it's a bit much to ask for a pause for intelligent public deliberation. I guess that's why it never seems to happen!
