I read Kevin Phillips <a href="http://www.harpers.org/archive/2008/05/0082023">cover article</a> [$$$] in this month's <em>Harper</em>'s, and thought he was completely crazy. First of all, I was amazed that they printed an article largely about one of my pet interests, the methodology of the Consumer Price Index, which I thought was a bit too esoteric for a general readership. But I was really baffled by Phillips' claim that the CPI <em>massively underestimates </em>inflation. Phillips thinks the Boskin revisions were a big mistake, despite the fact that they were <em>very </em>conservative, and most economists who know about this that I have talked to think the problem goes in the opposite direction. Tyler is his usual ambassadorial self in his blog review of Phillips' book <em>Bad Money</em> <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/04/bad-money.html">when he says</a>:
<blockquote>Either the current market estimate of inflation is the best estimate available, or you know that it is wrong and you will be a very rich man.Â  I find the former scenario more plausible.</blockquote>
But thankfully he really lays it out there in his comments:
<blockquote>A lot of the Phillips book is simply economically illiterate. For sure America has its economic problems, but they are not the ones identified in *Bad Money*</blockquote>
Perhaps it is time to convene an <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/">Overcoming Bias</a> colloquy about how it is that estimates of the trend in real wealth can be so massively divergent.
