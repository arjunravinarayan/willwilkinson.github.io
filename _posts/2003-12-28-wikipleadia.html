-- If you are so inclined, please <a href="http://www.wikimedia.org/letter.html">send a donation</a> to Wikipedia to help them raise money for new hardware. In my opinion, Wikipedia is among the most impressive open source efforts on the web. Because it's a Wiki encyclopedia, anyone at any time can modify an entry. You'd think some of it would turn out to be trash, but quite the opposite. Wikipedia has developed a solid community of volunteers who write, edit and police entries, and the trend so far has been one of improving quality, drawing on the distributed expertise of folks all over the net.

Wikipedia was founded by some old friends of mine, and I participated early on several years ago. It's fun to go back and look at entries you wrote, and see how they have and haven't changed. Once they get the server problems taken care of, I think I might get back in there.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nozick">Nozick</a> needs a lot of work, as does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gauthier">Gauthier</a>. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rawls">Rawls</a>, although much better, could use some help. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract_theories">contractarianism</a> is just some of Larry Sanger's old lecture notes. I encourage you to look at things you consider yourself in expert in, and see if you can improve on what's there.
