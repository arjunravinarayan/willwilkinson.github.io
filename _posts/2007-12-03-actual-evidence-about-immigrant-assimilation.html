At VoxEu Esther Duflo <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/763">outlines a new study</a> on assimilation of Muslim immigrants in Britain by LSE's Alan Manning and Sanchari Roy:
<blockquote>Manning and Roy rightly conclude that, on the basis of available evidence, Huntington’s pessimism - that Muslim immigrants will prove “indigestible” to non-Muslim societies, seems unjustified indeed. If anything, the constant reminders of “native” Europeans that there is “us” and “them”, the new, scary, Muslim immigrants and their offspring may do substantially more to create a rift than any religious or cultural feeling these immigrants have brought with them and transferred to their children.</blockquote>
So chill.
