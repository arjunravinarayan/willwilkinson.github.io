From the <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?pagewanted=2&pdate=20041015&v_id=309182&reviewer=A.+O.+Scott&title1=Team+America%3A++World+Police+%28Movie%29&title2=Team+America%3A+World+Police+%28Movie%29">NYT review</a> of "Team America," speaking of Stone and Parker:

<blockquote>It seems likely, though, that their emphases and omissions reflect a particular point of view.</blockquote>

Do you really think? I had been laboring under the impression that Trey Parker and Matt Stone, like all artists of genius, choose to put things in and leave things out of their non-infinite works soley on the basis of totally abstract and impartial standards of aesthetic excellence. If it's <em>likely</em> that their art reflects (well, come on, let's just say it: "is <em>tainted</em> by") a "particular point of view," isn't it likely that <em>other</em> creative works might also reflect a point of view? Am I to understand that the makers of <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em> had the crotchety Vice-President resemble Dick Cheney for, god forbid, <em>political</em> reasons? Christ, A.O.. Where were you when I was taking Introduction to Literature, when I needed you?

A.O. Scott, critical supergenius:

There is also this:

<blockquote>"South Park," with its class-clown libertarianism and proudly juvenile disdain for authority, has always been hard to place ideologically, but a number of commentators have discerned a pronounced conservative streak amid the anarchy, a hypothesis that "Team America" to some extent confirms.</blockquote>

Yes, libertarianism, even of the class-clown variety, is hard to place ideologically! It would be <em>too easy</em> to place it as libertarian. Hmmm... A.O. Scott, some day we will fathom your depths.
