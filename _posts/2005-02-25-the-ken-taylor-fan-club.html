Unless you're a philosophy dork like me, you've probably never heard of Kenneth Taylor of Stanford University. Well, now you have, and I think he's such a good philosopher, and such a cool guy (we've never met or corresponded), that I want to spread the word about his work. I think if more people learned to think like Ken Taylor, the world would be a rather better place.

Several years ago, I found his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1577180496/ref=sib_rdr_dp/103-8111218-4349406">Truth and Meaning</a></em> quite a help in studying for my philosophy of language comprehenive exam. Although, like all overviews of the philosophy of language, the book is a little dry, I was very impressed by Taylor's lucidity, and his elegant way of expressing hard problems. I found this passage (and the following disussion) especially striking:

<blockquote>There is no deeper and more difficult philosophical task than that of specifying a special reference-making relation from among the bloom and buzz of our total causal interaction with the world. For consider our situation as cognizers in the world we cognize. The world rushes in on us through the portals of sensation. Its causal effect on us begins as so many low-level irradiations at certain nerve endings. The causal chain set off by such waves of sensory irradiation ultimatley culminate in our cognition of the world in which we are embedded. Now the physicalist will say that the world that rushes in is, in one sense, a very meagre thing indeed. For at bottom, the physicalist will say, there is nothing but the quantum. All that there is -- planets and stars as well as persons and their minds and their bodies -- has its being in and through the existence of the quantum. Indeed, even the world's rushing in on mind is but some complex happening within the quantum. Yet the world we cognize partly as a result of the quantum's rushing in on mind is not merely a world of quantum flux. It is a world densely and diversely populated with all manner of things, with objects large and small, perceptible and imperceptible, with properties, familiar and exotic. Somehow between the low-level irradiations and the ultimate outpouring of cognition, reference to a rich and diverse world is made. The deep philosophical task of the would-be causal theorist who is committed to physicalism is to say how such a thing is possible.</blockquote>

You can tell that Taylor has actually <em>visualized</em> the problem, imagined it, because he is really, truly fascinated by the question. This is not a rote formulation. There is a hint of poetry, because Taylor himself really <em>wonders</em>. And wonder is the fire of philosophy. Perhaps this will seem strange to you, but when I first read this passage (when I was considering doing a dissertation on causal theories of reference), and when I read it now, something of the mystery of materialism comes through. How a thought can be a thing, and can reach out into the world across space and time and touch something, pull it out from the background and bring it into focus, though both thoughts and things are part of a continuous welter of quantum stirrings, well, that's just wonderful and mysterious, even magical -- but even more magical than magic, because it's not magic; the way the world works is really just that mysterious and weird. It's this kind of thought that convinces you, oddly enough, that there is a kind of satisfying spirtuality in a commitment materialism.
