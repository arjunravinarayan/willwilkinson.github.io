This week, <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/12629">I talk with Bruce Caldwell</a>, author of <em>Hayek's Challenge</em>, a wonderfully lucid, comprehensive, and penetrating account of the development of Hayek's economic and methodological ideas. Hayek is one of my enthusiasms, so I had a great time talking to Bruce, who knows as much about Hayek as anyone.

Also, maybe some of my Austrian-leaning readers can help out the BHTV commenters in their discussion of economic planning.
