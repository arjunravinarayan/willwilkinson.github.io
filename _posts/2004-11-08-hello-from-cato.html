<img alt="cato.jpg" src="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/archives/images/cato.jpg" width="270" height="336" class="floatimgright"/>I am now proudly ensconced in my new office at the world famous <a href="http://www.cato.org/index.html">Cato Institute</a>, where I have accepted a position as a Policy Analyst. I think the world of Cato, and so I'm just thrilled to be part of the team here. My brief is to work in policy areas that fall between the gaps of Cato's various areas of policy specialization, and to help identify new academics and experts to work with Cato as Fellows and Adjunct Scholars. Pretty exciting. Let freedom ring!
