Thanks to the hundreds who participated in the polls. I'm going to shut them off at noon, Iowa time.

The results of the basic Hood Conjecture poll will be easy to display, but the Magic Buttons need some slicing and dicing for useful visualization. Sadly, I am a spreadsheet tard. Anyone out there a Google Spreadsheet ninja who wants to make me cool charts?
