One major contention of recent work in "neo-classical liberalism," such as Jerry Gaus' The Order of Public Reason and John Tomasi's Free Market Fairness, is that a genuinely liberal system of institutions will afford economic rights and liberties the same protection standard contemporary liberals afford political and civil rights and liberties.

One of the main standard liberal arguments against the parity of the economic and political liberties is that the special protection of economic liberty will lead to the erosion of the the political liberties. One version of the argument goes something like this:

(1) Special protection of economic liberties (on par with the protection afforded political and civil liberties) leads the relatively unchecked development of inequalities in income and wealth.

(2) Unchecked economic inequalities lead to large inequalities in political influence.

(3) Large inequalities in political influence led to domination or capture of the institutions of "democratic" decisionmaking by wealthy interests.

(4) If the wealthy dominate or capture democratic institutions, the rights and interests of the non-wealthy will not be adequately protected.

(5) Without adequate protection of their rights and interests, the non-wealthy will suffer violated and their political liberties are deprived of real value.

(6) A liberal regime is a regime of equal liberty.

So, (7) A liberal regime must not afford special protection to economic liberties.

I have a number of problems with this argument. Indeed, my deepest objection comes with the first premise. I'd like to argue that (1) gets it quite wrong. Whether or not you are willing to concede this premise depends on how one understands economic liberty. The conception of economic liberty envisaged by the standard liberal seems to be

Without legal title to property recognized by local convention, the poor are locked out of capital markets that require legally acknowledged assets as collateral.Â  The fundamental requirement of economic liberty is a system of property rights
