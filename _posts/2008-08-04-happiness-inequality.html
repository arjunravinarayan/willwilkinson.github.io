Read Justin Wolfers <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/08/04/happiness-inequality-1-the-facts/">first in a trilogy of posts on U.S. happiness inequality</a> at Freakonomics.

Also check out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/opinion/27sun3.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=login">Eduardo Porter's account</a> of Stevenson and Wolfer's paper:
<blockquote>It seems odd that happiness would become more egalitarian over a period in which the share of the nationâ€™s income sucked in by the richest 1 percent of Americans rose from 7 percent to 17 percent. In fact, the report does find a growing happiness gap between Americans with higher levels of education and those with less, which is roughly in line with the widening pay gap between the skilled and unskilled.</blockquote>
