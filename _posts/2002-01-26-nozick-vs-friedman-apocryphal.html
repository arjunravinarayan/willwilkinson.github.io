<b>Nozick vs. Friedman: Apocryphal?</b> -- I just got this message from David Friedman that casts doubt on my secondhand story in the Nozick piece below:

"A philosopher friend once related a story of Nozick's one-upping David Friedman in a discussion first of philosophy, then of economics, and finally of particle physics. "

David Friedman:

<i>It isn't impossible, but I don't remember any such conversation. The only public exchange I can remember with Nozick was at an LP convention in New York, where I gave a talk on his book, he was in the audience, and we had an exchange after the talk. Interestingly enough, he didn't try to defend the argument against anarchism that he gave in his book, but instead fell back on the (I think stronger) argument that if a-c was really workable, we would expect to see some examples.</i>
