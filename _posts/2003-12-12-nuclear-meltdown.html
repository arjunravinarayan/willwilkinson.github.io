-- Charlotte Hays, on the <a href="http://www.iwf.org/inkwell/default.asp?archiveID=54">new IWF blog</a>, wonders whether killer moms are a consequence of the erosion of family values. Listen:

<em>With regard to Amanda Hamm, the latest mother to drown her children, the network news last night made a lot of the point that mothers who kill their children are more common than we think. But isnt it really *moms who have boyfriends* who kill their children? In the case of the deaths of Hamms three children, aged 23 months to six, boyfriend Maurice Lagrone Jr. has also been charged. They are eligible for the death penalty if convicted. I hate to say it, but: Couldnt the spate of killer moms have something to do with the dissolution of the two-parent family?</em>

Well, nice. First, is a spate really a spate, or did the press just happen on several provocative stories? And is a spate a trend? Are MORE kids being killed by their moms now than under other family arrangements?  Are more kids killed in Western two-parent households than in EVEN MORE TRADITIONAL extended families? (It's always interesting to note when one commences standing athwart history...]

Anyway, WHO CARES! Anything to keep the damn fags from getting hitched!!!
