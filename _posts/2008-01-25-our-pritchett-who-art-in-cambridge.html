Heads up, globalist pigs! Kerry's <a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/123912.html">interview with Lant Pritchett</a>, now online, is full of great stuff about how to increase liberty and well-being <em>at the same time</em>! Here's a taste:
<blockquote><strong>Pritchett: </strong>[...] Being against migration to the United States is wrong for two reasons. One, I don’t think it gets the scale of the poverty in the United States vs. poverty in the rest of the world right. Second, if you are really concerned about inequality in the United States, there are many things you can do that would be better than blocking other people from coming to our country. I don’t want to say that people who are concerned about inequality in the U.S. aren’t right to be concerned about inequality in the U.S. But I think taking that concern and using it to keep people from coming to the United States is victimizing the world’s true victims in favor of people who happen to live closer to you.

<strong>Reason</strong>: It seems strange to worry more about inequality within the arbitrary boundaries of a nation-state than about much larger global inequalities.

<strong>Pritchett</strong>: Exactly. I’ve never understood a view of the world in which the place in which a person was born becomes the key factor in whether you care about them.</blockquote>
Pritchett is nice; he says he doesn't understand this view of the world. What I'd like to think he means is that it is obviously a sign of a shamefully stunted moral sense to see shared national membership as the key condition for giving a damn.

The conclusion to Kerry's prelude is great:
<blockquote>What’s keeping so many would-be migrants in place? “Men with guns,” Pritchett says. His message is less a call to arms than a call to lay them down, less a provocation than a vision of a richer, better, freer world.</blockquote>
That's libertarianism right there.
