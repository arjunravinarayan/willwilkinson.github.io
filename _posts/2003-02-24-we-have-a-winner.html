-- The winner of the Name the Car contest is the ebullient <a href="http://knowledgeproblem.blogspot.com/">Lynne Kiesling</a>! This weekend, at the Mercatus Center Capitol Hill Campus Chiefs of Staff Retreat, Lynne suggested <a href="http://faq.macedonia.org/history/buke.html">Bucephalus</a>, the name of Alexander the Great's awesome stead... and I like it! So I hereby christen the Civic Buchephalus. And henceforth and forever so shall you be known.

So, Lynne, you're entitled to a dollar or a kiss.
