We have a Viszla and no children. He gets "ultra-premium" dog food, ridiculous toys, and relatively expensive treats (because he likes them better!) When we were deciding on a vet, we picked <a href="http://www.bebt.com/">the place run by people with degrees from Cornell</a>, because we looked it up and Cornell is the top-ranked vet school. I'm pretty sure we're not economizing. And I'm pretty sure <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/03/showing-that-yo.html">Robin Hanson's on the right track</a>. But it is <em>possible </em>to call around and get accurate quotes on the cost of neutering your dog. I didn't happen to call around because Winston gets the very best!Â (Also, I figured prices wouldn't vary that much in a competitive market.) I don't think Winston is impressed, but we're pretty happy with ourselves.
