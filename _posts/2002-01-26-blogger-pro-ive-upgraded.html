<b>Blogger Pro</b> -- I've upgraded to the new <a href="http://pro.blogger.com">Blogger Pro</a>, not because I really need it, but because it only seems fair to shoot a little money Ev's way for providing such a great free service for so long, and to keep this thing chugging. One new Blogger Pro function is the ability to send posts via email. Thus, I've created a YahooGroups list for those who'd like to get Fly Bottle posts in their Inbox. Send an email <a href="mailto: flybottleblog-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">here</a> to sign up.
