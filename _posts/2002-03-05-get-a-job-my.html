<b>Get a Job!</b> -- My employer, <a href="http://www.theihs.org">The Institute for Humane Studies</a>, is looking for a few good men and women to fight the good fight for liberty (and make my job less stressful). Go to the <a href="http://jobbank.pjdoland.com/show_mostrecent.php">job board </a>we maintain on <a href="http://www.libertyguide.com">Libertyguide.com</a> and look at the IHS listings for Manager, Program Director, and Program Assistant. We've got high standards, but if you think you meet them, please give it a shot.

And for God's sake don't contact me.
