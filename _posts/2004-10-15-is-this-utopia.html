My thought tends to vacillate between ideological extremism (in defense of liberty no vice!) and realpolitik pragmatism. When these tendencies meet, I find myself forced to admit that since 'ought' implies 'can', an ideal social outcome must, of course, be possible - there must be some historical path, some mechanisms of social change, that lead from here to there.

Now, it is often possible to imagine a path by imagining away some opposing force or faction. It is, for example, nice to imagine that our enemies have all changed their minds. But unless we can tell a plausible story about how those who stand in the way of our political dreams come to change their minds, we're indulging in wishful thinking (or "<a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2004/03/if_wishes_were_.html">pony talk</a>.") Other people's ideas, other people's political power, other people's imagined interests are real constraints on where we can get from here.

This kind of quasi-Hegelian consideration about the historically conditioned nature of political ideal tempts the thought that most actually existing liberal democracies, from Sweden to the US, are <em>very close approximations to utopia</em>, taking into account all  the relevant constraints.

This isn't a Beckereque point about efficiency (i.e., the system we've got is efficient, all things considered [trasactions/enforcement costs, etc.] or we'd already have a different system.) The point is more richly normative, not merely based on a notion of optimal satisfaction of preferences. The substantive contents of a notion of a good or just society -- liberty, stability, an open structure of opportunity -- are pretty well satisfied by the existing liberal democracies. (You've got to admit, whatever axe you have to grind, both Sweden and the United States of America are great achievements of human civilization.) Liberals of different stripes may be disatisfied about progress along certain dimensions. But when it comes time to say exactly what can <em>feasibly</em> be done to improve things on the dimension of liberty, equality, or whatever you're hot for, one finds that there are only fairly undramatic marginal changes within the space of plausible possibility.

It is tempting to argue that actual infeasibility is no objection to a normative view of a good society. One might, for instance, believe that the impediments to a better society are immoral. For instance, slavery is wrong, and a slave society is unjust, whether or not it happens to be socially feasible during some period of history to end slavery. Right? So if taxation is slavery, then a taxing society is illegitimate, whether or not it is infeasible to end taxation. Right?
