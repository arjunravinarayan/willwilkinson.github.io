These posts by Ezra and Julian made me think some clarification might be helpful. Bryan's notion of "rational irrationality" is a technical term in a formal model about economically rational deviations from "rational expectations." The meaning of 'rational' as it pertains to behavior has to do

Rational is a success term, and it applies differently to different forms of success.

The idea, as I understand it, is that individuals have preferences over states of affairs and beliefs. When the expected gain from having a true belief that P is higher than the false belief not-P

Suppose that an individual has well-defined preferences over states of affairs and beliefs about the world.  These preferences can be represented with indifference curves. (Diagram 2)  The agent’s wealth appears on the x-axis; the quantity of “irrationality” (deviation of the agent’s expectations from rational expectations) appears on the y-axis.  An agent who consumes zero y has rational expectations.  (After some point, y*, the slope of the indifference curve turns positive: agents deviate from rational expectations because they have a specific alternate belief that they like to think is true, not because they want to be as far from the truth as possible).  A conventional agent without belief preferences would have a set of vertical indifference curves.  In contrast, the indifference curves of an agent with belief preferences are negatively sloped until the agent reaches his belief “bliss point” y*, and positively sloped thereafter.

The agent’s budget line indicates the feasible set of wealth/irrationality bundles. (Diagram 3)  The slope of the price line shows how much material wealth one sacrifices as a result of holding irrational beliefs.7  Overestimating your ability to work while intoxicated exposes you to the risk of firing or lawsuits, and underestimating the efficacy of modern medicine compared to faith-healing forces you to forego potentially life-saving medical treatments.  The critical assumption of the model – the assumption which makes this a theory of rational irrationality rather than "irrational irrationality" – is that the agent perceives this budget line without bias.  On some level, the agent does form rational estimates of the attendant consequences of self-deception.  The agent then selects the wealth/irrationality bundle on the highest feasible indifference curve.  Material wealth is greatest when the agent has rational expectations (where the budget line crosses the x-axis), but agents with a taste for irrationality are likely to trade off some material wealth in exchange for more satisfying beliefs.
