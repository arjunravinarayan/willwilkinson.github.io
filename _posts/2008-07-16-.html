Thanks to Tyler's pointer, I found this <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~deaton/downloads/letterfromamerica_oct2004.html">amazing short essay by Angus Deaton</a> written in 2004. I had known of the correlation between income and mortality rates (as well as the reversal of the very longstanding trend toward equality in lifespans), but I had not seen this deeply troubling explanation of the mechanism.
<blockquote>[A]cross cities of the United States, income inequality (for example, as measured by the gini coefficient) is positively correlated with mortality rates. The effect is substantial: the probability of dying at any age increases by about 5 percent moving from a low (gini 0.35) to a high (gini 0.45) city. This finding has attracted attention among those who think of income inequality as a form of social pollution that is a direct hazard to health. The correlation is spurious, but the story behind it is an interesting one that brings us back to racial differences in health. In cities where there is a large African American population, white incomes are higher, and black incomes lower, which carries through to higher income inequality in the city. Predominantly black cities are unequal income cities. Once we condition on the fraction black, there is no correlation between mortality rates and income inequality.

But why should people (both black and white) die younger just because they live in cities with substantial black populations? Recent work has helped resolve the city puzzle, and casts light on why blacks have worse health outcomes than whites. Because blacks and whites are so residentially segregated, and because people seek physicians and hospitals in their own communities, there are essentially different sets of physicians and hospitals for blacks and for whites. A group led by Peter Bach at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, publishing in the New England Journal of Medicine in August this year, finds that eighty percent of doctor visits by black patients are made to less than a quarter of doctors who, in turn, rarely see white patients. Work by Jonathan Skinner and colleagues at Dartmouth documents the fine geographical structure of healthcare, and shows that both whites and blacks do worse in hospitals that treat more blacks. These findings hold for Medicare patients, whose age entitles them to close to free treatment at the point of care. The Sloan-Kettering study shows that the doctors who predominantly treat blacks are less wellqualified and are less likely to have access to the resources needed for advanced treatment.</blockquote>
Oh man. Anybody know of further work on this? Any reason to think Deaton's on the wrong track?

Here's my hesitantly offered thoughs. Slavery, segregation, and still-robust American racism (which helps generate the residential segregation Deaton mentions) gave African Americans no choice but to create alternative institutions. I live right next door to one, Howard University (where I spent a semester teaching philosophy). The black community rightly takes enormous pride in these institutions, created in the face of such appalling injustice and disadvantage. But because of that injustice and disadvantage, which has by no means dwindled away, most of these institutions have never had the financial means or broader political and social support to improve at the rate of mainstream institutions. But what can be done about this? A big redistributive push to equalize dominantly African American institutions just won't work for a lot of different of reasons. But suppose with enough money and resolve, we could ensure that training for African American physicians was as good as the norm, that facilities are as well-equipped. Who's going to tell African Americans to stop going to their trusted family doctor in the mean time? Who's going to say that the loyalty, solidarity, and community that has helped African Americans survive in an often hostile society can also be a danger to life?

I've got to say, I find writing about this extremely awkward, because I am a white guy from Iowa, and I share the usual horror of liberal white Americans of wandering into the minefield of racial sensitivity and losing a limb. But that horror, which leads to compassionate people just keeping their heads down and minding their own business, has got to be part of the problem. So let me give myself a medal for being so brave and ask again, what can be done about this?
