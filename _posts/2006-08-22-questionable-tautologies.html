From the incomparable, <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2006/aug/19/moral_quagmire">self-satirizing Stirling Newberry</a>:
<blockquote>Even today there are people arguing that Ayn Rand is a major "liberal" theorist, and fighting to preserve her holy memory on the internet. This from a philosophy that starts out from two questionable tautologies and worships getting cancer. No rhapsody anywhere in Rand's books surpasses her paean to smoking.</blockquote>
I don't know, if I'm going to question anything, it's not going to be a logical truth! And of course, the worst thing about Rand is... what? Smoking! This guy is a master of the unedited non-sequitur brain dump. Does he give money to Josh Marshall or something?
