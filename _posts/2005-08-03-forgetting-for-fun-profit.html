Via <a href="http://www.reason.com/hitandrun/2005/08/the_spotless_mi.shtml#010419">Jesse Walker</a>, comes <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4722225.stm">this BBC article</a> on the possibility of using beta blockers to blot out bad memories. This makes Jesse think of the Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I am put in mind of Thomas Schelling's amazing essay "The Mind as a Consuming Organ." A selection:

<blockquote>An unavoidable question is whether I could be happier if I could only believe things more favorable, more complimentary, more in line with my hopes and wishes, than what I believe to be true. That might be done by coming to believe things that are contrary to what I know, such as that my reputation or my health or my children's health is better than it is, my financial prospects or my childrens' better than they are, and that I have performed ably and bravely on those occasions when I did not. Or it might be accomplished by improving the mix of my beliefs by <em>dropping out--forgetting--some of the things that cause me guilt grief, remorse, and anxiety.</em> [emphasis added]</blockquote>

If the answer is, "Yes, you would be happier," then what is the correct response? So much the worse for truth? So much the worse for happiness? A subtle and cautious blend?
