Speaking of citizenships, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_nationality_law#Canadian_citizenship_by_descent">I just learned</a> that had Canadian law been what it is now when my father immigrated, I would now also be a Canadian citizen, which would be awesome. But, as it was prior to 1977, my father lost his Canadian citizenship when he became a naturalized American citizen, and so I was thereby preemptively stripped of my ancestral Canadian rights. Why Canada? Why?
