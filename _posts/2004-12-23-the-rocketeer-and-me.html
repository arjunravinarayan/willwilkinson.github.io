Frank McGahon, God bless'im, <a href="http://internetcommentator.typepad.com/internet_commentator/2004/12/eery.html">thinks I look like</a> Billy Campbell, who, it bears mentioning, was one of <em>People</em>'s 50 Most Beautiful People of 2000. The difference is, if <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0000124/">Jennifer Connelly</a> had dated <em>me</em>, she never would have left.
