Last week I guest-blogged at [Andrew Sullivan's](http://dish.andrewsullivan.com), whetting the blogging appetite, but there is an MFA thesis to write, so there won't be too much until summer. I'm not teaching in the Spring, so I'll be back, with a couple posts a week, at Democracy in America after the holidays.
