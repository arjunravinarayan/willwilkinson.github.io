Last week I guest-blogged at [Andrew Sullivan's](http://dish.andrewsullivan.com), whetting the blogging appetite, but there is an MFA thesis to write, so there won't be too much until summer. I'm not teaching in the Spring, so I'll be back at [Democracy in America](http://economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica) after the holidays with maybe a couple posts a week.
