(1) A system of relatively unfettered markets is justified only if unlimited economic growth is justified.
(2) Unlimited economic growth is justified only if greater wealth causes greater happiness.
(3) It's not the case that greater wealth causes greater happiness.
Therefore, (4) Unlimited economic growth is not justified,
and (5) Neither are relatively unfettered markets.

This is, of course, a bit of a cartoon argument, but close enough in spirit to a lot of what is implicit in the discussions of the alleged paradox of prosperity & happiness. We could talk about the strength of presumptions of justification, otyher things being equal, and so forth. But laying it out like this makes it easy to show what is wrong the a whole class of related arguments.

Let's just set aside (1) conceding for the sake of argument that a relatively unfettered market system is justified because it brings home the goods (as opposed to being justified as the outgrowth of an independently justified system of property rights, contract, etc.)

But lets think about (2). The first thing we could do is drive a wedge between happiness and self-reports of well-being. Kahneman in his paper on objective happiness more or less does this. What matters is how much pleasure people are actually experiencing at each instant, and how that adds up over a life, not what they say about themselves. He's a better Benthamite than the survey people.

But let's just say the survey data track real happiness, the kind that matters. The idea here is that either more wealth makes you happier, or it's not valuable--not worth having. But it seems clear to me that we ought to reject that premise. The existence of personal setpoints, hedonic adaptation, and the tendency to assess our well-being in terms of our relative position within our peer group make it pretty clear that after a certain point, there's little an already happy person can do to become significantly happier, and we shouldn't really expect more of <em>anything</em> to have an abiding effect. So it's just not reasonable to expect more wealth to make happy people even happier.
