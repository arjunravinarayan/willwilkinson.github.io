<b>Soviet Mass Murder and Never Saying Sorry --</b> I'm very excited by the appearance of Martin Amis's new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0786868767/qid=1026849230/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-0321609-2984922">Koba the Dread: Laughter and the Twenty Million.</a> Amis addresses the question why the 20 million Soviet dead has never been considered with the same moral seriousness as the victims of the Holocaust, and why Stalinist apologists have hardly begun to be adequately contrite for their sanction of such a vast, bloody moral horror. Apparently he calls bullshit on Hitchens. Good <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2002/07/16/amis/index.html?x">Salon review</a> by Charles Taylor. I'm picking this up from Amazon now.
