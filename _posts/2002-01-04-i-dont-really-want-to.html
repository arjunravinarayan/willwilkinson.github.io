<b>I Don't Really Want to be Having This Debate</b> -- But Christopher Johnson of Midwest Conservative Journal also <a href="http://quantrill.tripod.com/MCJ.html">misses the distinction</a> between total harm and net benefit. And in any case, my original point was only that questions of better require answers to questions of better for what. I have no clear idea whether the benefits minus the harms of Christianity is positive or not. My contention is only that Christianity has killed more people, wrecked more lives, and squelched more liberty than Hustler and "American Booty." And if porn objectifies women (and men too, Christopher), one would like to hear exactly what is the harm in that, and how it is worse than burning Bruno, say, at the stake. Christopher seems also to overlook that porn provides an enormous amount of pleasure and satisfaction for millions. Is that not a cultural achievement?

I really don't care to be defending porn, because it's beside the point at issue with Goldberg. The point is that cultural libertarianism is not relativistic or nihilistic, and that everyone, conservatives included, have a "Chinese Menu" attitude toward culture, and there ain't nothing wrong with that.
