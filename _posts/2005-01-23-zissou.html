The Life Aquatic seems to be hard for people to good a grasp on. Here's my take, probably flawed.

It is a good movie about a bad filmmaker. It is, I conjecture, a film made in the style of Steve Zissou about the making of a film by Steve Zissou based on a Jane Winslett-Richardson Oceanographic Explorer cover article. Wes Anderson's movies are all stilted and staged, but this one is even more so, and the reason is that Steve Zizzou films are stilted and staged. But Steve Zissou is strange animal. He is a child's fantasy about the life of an adventurer who has become aware of and depressed about his own decline -- as if characters in works of fiction play their roles not simply at the pleasure of their authors, but must will their own participation in the story. Steve Zissou exists in the minds and hopes of children. The attitude of children toward romantic quasi-scientific adventurism is at the very center of the movie. The fantasy of Zissou looms large in the childhood of both Ned and Jane. Anderson depicts sea life in the way a child would imagine the exotic wonders of the ocean. The film ends with Steve giving Ned's Zissou Society ring to the boy in lederhosen (Werner?), hoisting him up on his shoulders, striding off in triumph. (More about which later.)

At the beginning of the film, Zissou is a has-been, and has simply given up. He is superfluous. He has only his loyal crew who still believe in him, and when his best friend dies he begins to lose his grip. All that he has left to motivate him is vengeance. But then Ned appears, thinking he may be Zissou's child. Zissou knows he is not (as we are told near the end of the movie, he "shoots blanks," and he must know this). But Ned retains a child's fantasy about Zissou, as indicated by his ring, and in this the embittered and vengeful Zissou sees that the fantasy of Zissou still fires the imagination, and in this he finds hope of redemption. Zissou's desire to fulfill his role in the fantasy-life of children is portrayed as ridiculous vanity and self-love. But it is this vanity and self-love, his aspiration to fulfill children's dreams, that motivates Zissou to act nobly -- to risk his live clearing the Belafonte of pirates, to rescue Bill Ubell, the bond company guy, and even his nemesis, Hennessey. It is only with regret that Zissou, who at one level is consumed by narcissism, leaves behind Cody, the three-legged pirate dog.


On the other hand, it is about about adult disenchantment and self-dissapointment in our failure to live up to our fantasies about ourselves. On this score, the Life Aquatic is really a very simple film with a very old-fashioned theme: base emotions--petty self-love,  can be harnessed to create virtue.
