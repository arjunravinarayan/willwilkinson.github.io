Check out Arnold and Brian's <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/">swank new digs</a> over at EconLog. More generally, check out the redesigned <a href="http://www.econlib.org/">Library and Economics and Liberty</a>, including the new edition of the <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Intro.html">Concise Encyclopedia of Economics</a>. It looks great and is a phenomenal resource.
