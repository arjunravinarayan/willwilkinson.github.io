Greg Ransom is running <a href="http://hayekcenter.org/?p=761">a silly poll</a>. It's silly because I'm on it, and there are apparently 16 people -- putting me somewhere between my heroes Vernon Smith and Douglass North -- who think I'm tops. Eat it Taleb. The volume of voting seems to be low, so we could take this, sports fans. Thomas Sowell? Don Boudreaux? Russ Roberts? Who are these people? Have you ever seen Israel Kirzner <em>in public</em>? I can't say that I have.
