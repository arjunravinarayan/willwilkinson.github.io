This looks like <a href="http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3084745">an interesting book</a>. It's hard to get the right balance between maximization and reciprocity to enable broad, complex social cooperation. I think that if more people had a better grasp of the huge benefits of effective social coordination, together with the delicate balance of cognitive and emotive capacities needed to sustain it, then there would be much much less mystification about morality.
