Maybe social software can't topple dictators, but it can <a href="http://www.freep.com/article/20110216/NEWS01/110216015/Sci-fi-fans-rejoice-RoboCop-statue-coming-Detroit?odyssey=tab|topnews|text|FRONTPAGE">put up the money for a statue of RoboCop</a> in downtrodden Detroit.

A little over a week ago, a guy from Massachusetts suggested via Twitter to Detroit's mayor that the city raise a monument to RoboCop, "a GREAT ambassador for Detroit." The Mayor, Dave Bing, tweeted in reply that "There are not any plans to erect a statue to RoboCop. Thank you for your suggestion." But the suggestion didn't then simply disappear into the abyss of the municipal suggestion box. Once unleashed upon Twitter, the savvy use of social media swiftly transformed an amusing suggestion into a concrete plan to put a RoboCop statue in the Motor City. A "<a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=176409349068272">Build a Statue of RoboCop in Detroit</a>" Facebook page sprung up, quickly followed by a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/imaginationstation/detroit-needs-a-statue-of-robocop">campaign on Kickstarter</a> to "crowd-source" the funds to create the statue. Within days, the Kickstarter campaign exceeded its $50,000 goal, and plans are afoot to situate a metal replica of the iconic half-man, half-death-machine constable in Detroit's Roosevelt Park, across from the picturesque decay of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Central_Station">Michigan Central Station</a>.

It's easy to imagine why Detroit's powers-that-be might wish to distance themselves from a famous cinematic symbol of Detroit's status as a crumbling dystopia, and it's easy to see a $50,000 RoboCop statue as a cruel joke on a struggling city. But it is also possible to see the promising project as a glimmer of hope. If Detroit's going to make a comeback, it will need a lot of this sort of bottom-up initiative and energy. If a cast-iron monument to RoboCop suggests resignation to Detroit's decline, it also suggests the playful will to keep Detroit alive as a subject of imagination, and in imagination there is hope. The big question is whether social sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Kickstarter can facilitate projects that go beyond the amusement of well-wired geeks to actually help revitalize suffering cities like Detroit.
