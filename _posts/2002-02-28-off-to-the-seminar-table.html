<b>Off to the Seminar Table</b> -- I'll be gone over the weekend to attend a seminar about welfare and individual responsibility with a bunch of grad students, so I won't be posting. However, I'll try to make it up to you Sunday night. My hope is that a bunch of Ph.D. students from ritzier schools than mine will stimulate some fresh thoughts. If so, I'll share them. Oh, and won't you be lucky.
