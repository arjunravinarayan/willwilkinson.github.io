In a reply to a half-joke from Kerry about wives stuck at home watching soaps, <a href="http://culture11.com/blogs/theconfabulum/2008/11/20/traditional-gender-roles/">Conor Friedersdorf writes</a>:
<blockquote>Indeed if I one day find myself writing at home and acting as primary caregiver for my 3 or 4 year old I’ll count raising him or her as a task far more important — and an achievement justifying more pride — than any writing most people in the world will ever produce.</blockquote>
I think this is a nice example of the kind of piety about the nobility of childrearing that completely pervades our culture and, yes, tends to reinforce social norms that hurt women.

To choose to have a child is to accept weighty obligations. Raising your kids, once you've chosen to have them, is probably more important than most competing claims on your time. Which is why, if you want anything else out of life, you should think pretty carefully about whether the obligations of responsible parenthood are compatible with those other aims. Men (but not Conor, clearly) tend not to think all that hard about this, because they tend to assume the wife will have most of it covered, and in fact the wife tends to cover most of it. Women tend not think hard <em>enough </em>about it, either because they were subtly or not-so-subtly discouraged from developing big ambitions, hopefully think they can "have it all," or have come to accept that the honor of motherhood dwarfs all other conceivable achievements.   

I find myself somewhat stunned by the idea that simply raising a child is "an achievement justifying more pride" than, say, having written a decent novel or operating a successful string of restaurants. Consider that <em>your parents </em>managed the feat. Who among us is <em>proud</em> of her parents' achievement in meeting the obligations of parenthood. I'm <em>grateful </em>to my parents for my life, but I'm not especially <em>proud</em> that they managed to pay the bills and pass along some valuable human capital. Almost anybody can do it! A well-adjusted child is not a mark of distinction.

I suppose it's nice to have the cultural equivalent of a progressive elementary school's field day where all win the same ribbon. "Way to go in the two-legged race and the not forgetting your kid in Costco!" Without a doubt, child-rearing is a huge amount of work, and often an  immense sacrifice. But one mildly entertaining mystery novel or one nicely profitable business, probably creates more value for other people than does the average child who, chances are, is not going to be Mozart, much less a mildly successful mystery novelist. If you find caring for children more meaningful than the foregone attempt to achieve something rarer, then you should of course have children. But, just as long as women tend to get saddled with the work of childcare, the idea that rearing churchgoing voters merits a McArthur grant is exactly the kind of thing that keeps more women from doing the kinds of things that actually merit McArthur grants.
