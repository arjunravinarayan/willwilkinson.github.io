Ron Bailey <a href="http://www.reason.com/rb/rb121404.shtml">points out</a> that you're rather less likely to be killed by weather if you're rich, or at least in a rich country. This is reason #793 why a decent rate of economic growth is in my holy trinity of political goods, along with liberty and stability.

By the way, I plan to interview Ron here on The Fly Bottle in anticipation of his new book, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;path=ASIN%2F1591022274%2Fqid%253D1103089195%2Fsr%253D11-1%2Fref%253Dsr%255F11%255F1">Liberation Biology</a>"</em>, which ought to be a humdinger. I think Ron may be the best science journalist working today. He is also very tall. You can <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;path=ASIN%2F1591022274%2Fqid%253D1103089195%2Fsr%253D11-1%2Fref%253Dsr%255F11%255F1">pre-order</a>  on Amazon today!
