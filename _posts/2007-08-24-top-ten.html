I was alerted today that <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=999653">my happiness paper</a> has edged into the top ten downloads in a couple of SSRN categories. Apparently it doesn't take much. (11 whole downloads! Woo!) Anyway, I sense that these things can be sort of self-reinforcing. People want to read what other people have read. So, if you think you'd like to read my happiness paper, but haven't yet had a chance, feel free to <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=999653">download it today</a>. You'll help keep it in the top ranks for a while, and helping to increase the chance that some who might not otherwise will read it, too.
