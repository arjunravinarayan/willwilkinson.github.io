I just discovered that Deidre McCloskey has posted on <a href="http://deirdremccloskey.org/">her website</a> <a href="http://deirdremccloskey.org/docs/bv_deeds.doc">a draft</a> [doc] of the second volume of her work on bourgeois virtues. For those of us who love the history and anthropology of morality <em>and </em>economic history <em>and </em>rhetoric <em>and </em>political economy, McCloskey's hard to beat for interestingness value.
