-- Don Boudreaux, of the fun, new Cafe Hayek, <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2004/04/index.html#a0001298450">excerpts and comments upon a passage</a> of Dave Schmidtz's from <em>Social Welfare and Individual Responsibility</em>  (a point/counterpoint affair with Robert Goodin) about income inequality. Dave asks an absolutely crucial question about the sources of income gaps that, astonishingly enough, very smart people often never ask.
