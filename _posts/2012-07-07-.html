From now until the election, I am going to make one drawing of Obama or Romney or some other significant figure in political news <em>every week</em>. I'll invite bloggers to use them for free, and, in the unlikely event of interest from professional publication,Â will happily accept all reasonable offers from editors or art directors. Why? To make myself draw. Glory.
