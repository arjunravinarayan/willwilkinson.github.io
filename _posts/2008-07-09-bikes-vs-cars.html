Interesting discussions at <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/drivers_or_bikers_who_sucks_mo.php">Megan's</a> and <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/get_your_war_on.php#comments">Matt's</a>. I think Matt does an exceptionally good job of illustrating the arbitrariness of subsidies to car owners simply by outlining an alternative scheme. I've always been a bit baffled by a lot of libertarian's generally pro-car-centric view of transportation matters. Now, if cars, highways, roads, big parking lots, etc., really are the most efficient way to do things, all things considered, then sure. But I never get a clear sense from many libertarians that they grasp the extent of the subsidies, or the very significant crowding-out effects of our massively expensive state-supported auto-based transportation infrastucture.

Also, bikes. People complain about bikers breaking traffic laws. Well, I'm guilty, and I'm damn well going to keep doing it. A lot of traffic regulations make sense for cars, but just don't for bikes. For example, I ride home almost every day the wrong way up a one way street, and nobody coming the other way gives a damn.  Why should they? I honestly don't give a fig about my carbon footprint (and anyway, since I'm not a breeder, I really should get carbon carte blanche). But I like biking because it's faster than driving -- <em>because</em> I blow through stop signs, go the wrong way on one-ways, etc. Were I suddenly to become fastidious about heeding traffic laws <em>intended to regulate cars, </em>one of the main advantages of biking over driving would evaporate. So I think people who do give figs about carbon really ought to <em>encourage</em> bikers to break traffic laws, or at least promote EXTRA traffic laws for drivers, in order to increase the relative benefit of biking. How about intersections where four-way purple means you've got to stop unless you're on a bike? That would be pretty sweet.
