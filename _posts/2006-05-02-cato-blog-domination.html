If you haven't heard tell, Cato has a new blog, <a title="Cato @ Liberty" href="http://cato-at-liberty.org/">Cato@Liberty</a>, featuring the entire Cato policy staff commenting on news, recent events, and pressing issues that concern us all! We're just getting started, but I don't think you'll <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Cato-at-liberty">regret adding @Liberty to your feedreader</a>. Once we all get up to speed on this blogging thing, we're going to be hard to beat as a policy and politics blog. If you have a blog, run, don't walk to your keyboard (hey! you made it already!) and spread the happy news.

And don't forget <a title="Cato Unbound" href="http://www.cato-unbound.org">Cato Unbound</a>! Our new issue, "<a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/issues/the-gop-and-limited-government-do-they-have-a-future-together">The GOP and Limited Government: Do They Have a Future Together?</a>" is hot off the virtual presses with a rather <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/05/01/david-frum/republicans-and-the-flight-of-opportunity/">depressingly convincing  lead essay</a> by bestselling political author and former Bush speechwriter David Frum. This month's commentators are the left's favorite Goldwater Republican, Bruce Bartlett, Cato's own executive VP, David Boaz, and pointyheaded wonderboys <a href="http://theamericanscene.com/">Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam</a>.

Cato offers <em>all this <strong>top quality content</strong> </em>to you for <em><strong>free</strong></em>! What a deal! Thanks Cato!
