<a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/04/just-how-good-w.html">Tyler</a> and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/04/the-6yr-old-rep.html">Alex's son</a> give their impressions of the party at Robin Hanson's lovely home yesterday afternoon. It's a special kind of relief to be able to spend a few hours with a whole house full of people with whom one does not have to be defensive about thinking rationally (i.e. "reductively", "autistically", "soullessly") about tough questions. This is a party where you're the weird one if you don't think it's appropriate to apply cost-benefit analysis to the choice to have kids, or if you don't think it's more or less obvious that open immigration is welfare-enhancing, or that robots are awesome. Good times. Here's some pics.
