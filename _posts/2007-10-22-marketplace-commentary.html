I was on Marketplace Morning Edition this morning, providing <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/10/22/more_to_lose_from_fear_than_foreign_trade_/">a commentary on America's dismal attitude toward trade.</a>

If you're reading this, you know my blog is not in fact theflybottle.com. And I really need to get my Cato picture updated.

This was my first shot at this sort of thing. Please tell me what you think...
