From <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.economics.harvard.edu%2Ffaculty%2Fglaeser%2Fpapers%2FReview_Florida.pdf&ei=PgxFRNyqD7yCap7M2JME&sig2=L8rV6ARzMJBh5O7Tkwr2cA">Ed Glaeser's review</a> [pdf] of Richard Florida's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465024777/theflybottle-20"><em>Rise of the Creative Class</em></a>:
