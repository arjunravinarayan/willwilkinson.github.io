GEESE fly south, then north again. Rivers run from high to low. The planets whirl in well-worn courses. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704893604576200983883174452.html">Max Boot wants to start a war</a>. He suggests sending an aircraft carrier bristling with "34 F/A-18F Super Hornets and 10 F/A-18C Hornets along with a full complement of electronic-warfare aircraft". (Mr Boot clearly relishes the killing toys.) But a no-fly zone may not be enough to do the trick, he says. Thus, "It may also be necessary to send arms and Special Forces trainers to support the rebels." But <em>why</em>?
<blockquote>[T]here is no question that [President Obama's] weak, vacillating response to the slaughter now unfolding in Libya will reduce American power and prestige in ways that will do us incalculable long-term harm.</blockquote>
Wait, Mr Boot, there <em>is</em> a question! And I suppose there's no point weighing the costs and benefits of a third war in the Middle East if the harm that will come to <em>us</em> from failing to start one is "incalculable". But, really, there is no question that serious people do not deliberate like this, and that crediting this sort of keyboard brinkmanship has already done Americans (and Iraqis and Afghanis) incalculable harm. I implore Mr Boot to look to Ross Douthat's blog to learn what creditable conservative deliberation on this question sounds like.

In the course of reply to an argument of David Frum's in favour of a no-fly zone, Mr Douthat <a href="http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/10/the-perils-of-a-no-fly-zone/">draws out an all-too-likely scenario</a> of American intervention:
<blockquote>Frum argues that our list of friends in the Middle East has grown short of late, and if we’re perceived to have acquiesced in the ouster of pro-American leaders in Egypt and Tunisia and then fail to back up our demands that an anti-American leader be ousted in Libya, both “American credibility and the stability of the Middle East region” will be dealt a significant blow. But what will happen to American credibility if we effectively declare war on Libya and then fail to dislodge Qaddafi, because he’s well-entrenched and we aren’t willing to escalate beyond air cover? It seems all-too-plausible that rather than vindicating American power, a no-fly zone will ultimately just make the United States look like more of a paper tiger: We’ll demonstrate that we’re capable of going halfway to war, but no further, and Libya’s tyrant will be able to claim that he fought America and won.</blockquote>
In his excellent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/opinion/14douthat.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">Monday column</a>, Mr Douthat argues against those suffering selective amnesia about Iraq and Afghanistan that the case for intervention in Libya is far from compelling. And in a <a href="http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/war-and-responsibility/">follow-up blog post</a>, Mr Douthat responds very sensibly to the claim that the fate of Libya is America's responsibility:
<blockquote>As the dominant power in the globe, we have some responsibility for furthering peace and order just about everywhere on earth. But just as you have certain obligations to your brother or cousin’s or neighbor’s child, but a far greater responsibility for a child that you adopt, so a great power’s obligations increase when it assumes an active role in the politics of another country — and so do the responsibilities it bears for any subsequent disasters. Which is, in turn, a good reason to be wary of taking on too many of those obligations in the first place.

I think this is intuitively obvious when one starts to consider real world examples. Does anyone seriously think that the United States bears just as much responsibility for the horrors of the Congolese civil war (which we “let fester,” in Feaver’s phrase) as it does for the post-invasion violence in Iraq? As much responsibility for the casualties in, say, the various India-Pakistan wars as for the casualties in our own war in Vietnam? As much responsibility for the deaths in Europe from 1914 to 1917 as for the deaths in the Philippines during our occupation of those islands? We may bear a share of responsibility for casualties that result from our inaction rather than our actions, but the two ledgers aren’t comparable.

To argue otherwise would be to multiply American obligations beyond reason.</blockquote>
I entirely agree with Mr Douthat, except for the claim that "we have some responsibility for furthering peace and order just about everywhere on earth." <em>We</em>, meaning the American state and its subject, have no such responsibility. And it bears emphasising that <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/03/national-greatness_imperative">national-greatness neocons</a> such as Mr Boot may find the prospect of multiplying American obligations beyond reason exhilarating.
