My short "Dispatch" item on traveling to Ottawa to become suddenly always Canadian appears in the new issue of <em>The Atlantic</em>, which is now available <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200910/canadian-citizenship">online</a> and at fine news stands everywhere. A snippet:
<blockquote>After dining with other lost Canadians the evening before I became a citizen, I found myself walking the not-so-mean streets of Ottawa alone an hour before midnight. So I wandered into the <a href="http://www.royaloakpubs.com/" target="outlink">Royal Oak</a>, an English pub on Bank Street. I persuaded some game locals, Austin and Rachelle, to share a toast and snap my picture in front of the Maple Leaf hanging behind the bar. Midnight! To gain a citizenship in one magical moment, without exertion or will, is to experience as an adult the national baptism that comes with birth. I felt exhilarated, if a bit of a fraud. Austin and Rachelle were exceedingly kind to me. We exchanged cell-phone numbers. We agreed to connect on Facebook. We all understood that I am a thoroughgoing American, qualifying as Canadian through a weird technicality. But they were happy for me, happy to have me. Because they’re Canadians, I suppose.</blockquote>
