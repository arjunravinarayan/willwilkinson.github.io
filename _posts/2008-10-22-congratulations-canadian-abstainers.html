In today's Ottawa Citizen, I tell my Canadian friends <a href="http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/views/story.html?id=db7a6bcc-3e7d-4965-8621-6a8fc796869b">not to worry</a> about their historically low levels of turnout in the last election.

Who knows if my insane call for responsible voting or the insidious tactics of ACORN pose the greater threat to the legitimacy of our democracy!?
