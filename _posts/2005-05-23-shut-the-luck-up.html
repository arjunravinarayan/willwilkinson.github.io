Matt Miller seems to write the same opinion piece about luck <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2003/09/28/the_wages_of_luck/">over</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/21/opinion/21miller.html?hp=&pagewanted=print">over</a> again. Maybe if he says it enough times he'll be right.

Here's <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/081104F.html">my take</a> on the connection between luck and redistribution.

Reihan Salam over at The American Scene has <a href="http://www.theamericanscene.com/2005/05/what-is-luck-anyway-matt-miller-is.php">a very smart post</a> on the Miller refrain, about which I hope to say something later.
