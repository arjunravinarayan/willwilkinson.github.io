It can be tough to prepare for a substantive diavlog (you know, something more than just "let's talk about the headlines") every week, so Kerry and I, together with the BHTV authorities, have decided to more or less split weekly Free Will duties. Kerry's first unresponsibly unheralded Free Will was two weeks ago <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/15556">with MIT philosopher Sally Haslanger</a>. <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/15902">This week she's up with Kenan Malik</a>, author of <em>Strange Fruit: Why Both Sides Are Wrong in the Race Debate </em>talking<em> </em>about<em> </em>racial categorization, multiculturalism, and the desirability of cultural preservation. For my part, next week I will appear talk with Columbia's Andrew Gelman about trends in American voting.
