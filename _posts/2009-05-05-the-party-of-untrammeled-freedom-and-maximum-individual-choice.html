<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/opinion/05brooks.html?em">David Brooks</a>:
<blockquote>[I]f Republicans had learned the right lessons from the Westerns, or at least John Ford Westerns, they would not be the party of untrammeled freedom and maximum individual choice. They would once again be the party of community and civic order.</blockquote>
What in tarnation is this man talking about? Where is this Republican Party of "untrammeled freedom and maximum individual choice"? Did Ron Paul just become House minority leader or take Michael Steele's job or something? Have the Republicans put up the white flag in the War on Drugs? Are GOP Senators stumping to end the legislation of morality? How did I miss this? It's like Brooks was kidnapped by a Romulan and is sending us op-eds from an alternative timeline.
