"In the mid-twentieth century John Rawls single-handedly revived Anglo-American political philosophy, which had not seen significant progress since the development and elaboration of utilitarianism in the 19th century.‚Äù - Richard Arneson

Tomasi's not jokin' about that myth of modern liberalism. Let's think for just a moment...
The neo-Hegelian "New Liberals" (Green, Bosanquet, Hobhouse) perhaps including John Dewey in the U.S.? Don't all those Germans and Austrians writing in English count? Strauss, Arendt, Mises, Hayek? Popper? What about Oakshott and Berlin? Sidgwick straight to Rawls with no "significant progress" between? Really? Well, it's in the Oxford Handbook of Political Theory!
