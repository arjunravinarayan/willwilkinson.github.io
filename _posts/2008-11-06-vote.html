Oh, I missed this one....

I didn't vote. I know. It doesn't make any sense! And look what happened. Tom Harkin is still my Senator.

Just think: If <em>only 750</em> Democrats had moved to Minnesota and voted, Al Franken would be Senator-elect Al Franken. Don't <em>ever</em> let anyone tell you that moving to Minnesota doesn't matter!

A game: Think of other verbs for which it does not sound like nonsense to urge people to do it unconditionally. Then consider whether "vote" has similar properties.
