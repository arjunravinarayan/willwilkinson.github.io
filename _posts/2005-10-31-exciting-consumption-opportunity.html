Tim Harford's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0195189779/theflybottle-20/103-8111218-4349406?creative=327641&camp=14573&link_code=as1">The Undercover Economist</a> officially goes on sale tomorrow, but, hey, you can buy it today. You can, in fact, click my link, and I'll get a kickback. Why am I shilling for Tim? Because he's written a great book that you'll like, he gives me good beer, and he can give me even more beer if he sells books!
