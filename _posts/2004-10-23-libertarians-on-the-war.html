Because I felt incredibly terrible yesterday, I wasn't able to attend the <a href="http://www.cato.org/events/041022conf.html">Cato debate on the War</a>. Do check out, however, <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/blog/comments.php?id=P1381_0_1_0">Raimondo's account</a> of the event, and Chris Sciabarra's <a href="http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/8136.html">smart attempt</a> to defend Rand against her defenders.
