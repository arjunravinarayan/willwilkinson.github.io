I <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2092-1399754,00.html">agree with Warnock</a> that not only should euthanasia be allowed, but that the stigma attached to surrendering to death be relaxed.

The amount of money spent to keep alive people for whom life has become nothing more than a searing wait for death is abominable. I cannot imagine wanting to spend tens of thousands of dollars to extend my life a couple extremely miserable months when I could otherwise give it to my children or charity. Indeed, if I had to spend that money on myself, I would rather use it to finance a truly  glorious death.
