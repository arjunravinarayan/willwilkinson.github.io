Intrinsically worthwhile.

Munro asks, "Has anybody ever written a book that was really good with people who are nice all the time, or even part of the time?" Atwood doesn't think so.

Munro on the hate mail of her early days: "I didn't understand that you read books in order to feel that the world is better than it is. And so I was offending without really understanding it for quite a while." But folks came around.

My heart aches for my Canadian grandmother.
