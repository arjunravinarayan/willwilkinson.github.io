I think the whole argument about the extent to which public-sector workers are and are not overcompensated is largely a distraction. Government employees without special legal augmentation of their bargaining power nevertheless constitute several powerful lobbies. It would be surprising, however, if unions delivered nothing. Of course, there is a public-sector union wage premium.

This <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~blnchflr/papers/what%20do%20unions%20do.pdf" target="_self">David Blanchflower and Alex Bryson paper</a> (see pp.9-10), using 1980s data, finds a union wage premium, for state employees, of 14.5 percent, with the premium being strongest for unskilled workers, as is the case in the private sector as well.  (NB: I am not sure if they are adjusting for differential benefits but I think not.)  Alan Krueger <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=-ekHL1ACBHUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=unions+public+sector+wage+premium&amp;ots=kxp09fS9_j&amp;sig=G_aEKbUKKmrKa8TjRcXenA359uw#v=onepage&amp;q=unions%20public%20sector%20wage%20premium&amp;f=false" target="_self">tells us</a> that the union/non-union wage gap is smaller in the public sector than in the private sector ("overwhelming evidence").

I'm not pushing any particular answer, I'd just like to put the question on the table.  What else do you all know?

<strong>Addendum</strong>: <a href="http://modeledbehavior.com/2010/08/09/the-power-of-public-sector-unions/" target="_self">from Adam Ozimek</a>: "The regression coefficients on page 8 of the report show that the union wage premium is between 15% to 16%, while the public sector wage discount is around 11%, meaning unionized public sector employees are paid 4% to 5% wage premium."  Adam also provides further references and discussion.

And progs seem hell-bent on ignoring what I like to call the "uncertainty-reduction" premium, which is the <em>combined</em> value (as determined by government workers' willingness-to-pay) of increased job security, lower income volatility, premium health plans, and defined-benefit pensions. This value is unknown.  but I would not be surprise to find that it is has been "large and continuously increasing".
