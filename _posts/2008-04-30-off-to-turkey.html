After the <em>Nudge </em>forum tomorrow afternoon, Kerry and I are off to Turkey for about a week and a half. The deafening silence you will hear is me on a beach worrying about work. Anyway, we've made absolutely no plans, other than arranging a rental car in Istanbul. For all I know we'll be sleeping in it. If you've been to Turkey and know of awesome stuff to do and see, please report below. If you can (in)validate guidebook stuff, that's terrific, but if you know anything weird, out of the way, or word-of-mouthy, even better.
