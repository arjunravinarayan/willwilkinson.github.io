Sorry so quiet! I've been busy doing things. You know how it is. Here is <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/12885">the latest Free Will</a>, in which I talk with Jesse Prinz, whose book <em><a href="http://astore.amazon.com/theflybottle-20/detail/019928301X">The Emotional Construction of Morals</a> </em>is awesome. Here is <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/07/31/wilkinson_energy/">today's Marketplace commentary</a>, in which I note that T. Boone Pickens is trying to use the public's anti-foreign bias and bottomless ignorance to help rig the regulatory structure in his favor. I think of it as the Swift Boat Veterans for windmills project. (Some of the commenters seem not to realize that this kind of mixed environmentalist/energy independence play is <em>exactly </em>how we got the now locked-in subsidies for ethanol they so vigorously decry. Also, I am an idiot for thinking that people will buy things, and producers will produce them, when the price is right.)

I'll be off next week to Michigan for a Liberty Fund conference on Adam Smith. And then I'm moving to Iowa City with Kerry, where she will start work on her MFA in creative nonfiction while I will do exactly the same thing [as I am doing now, i.e., working for Cato], but from a different place. We will be <em>so far </em>from the Orange Line. Expect puppy-blogging.
