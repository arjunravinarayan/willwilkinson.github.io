In David Gauthier's 1989 Phil. Rev. review of <a href="http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/sen86.pdf">Sen's second Tanner Lecture</a>, Gauthier argues that Sen shouldn't say that a guy whose lived a miserable life amassing a fortune shouldn't be said to have had a low standard of living, but instead had failed to secure the excellent quality of life available to him with such a magnificent standard of living. Does that make sense to you? I think it's a good point.
I'm attracted to Sen's capabilities view, but I'm still wary of it. It strikes me as a bit <em>too </em>objectivist. Or maybe the question is how we identify the relevant functionings that constitute well-being. By 'too objectivist' I don't mean that it gives short shrift to how we feel subjectively. That's not my worry. I mean I worry that it gives short shrift to our individual life-projects. If you could take the set of people, and then show that every project of every person required certain functionings, then you'd be a close to home. Or even if you showed that <em>almost </em>all the projects required certain functionings. But you wouldn't be all the way home. Because I think that some weird projects require weird functionings. And I don't want to say that these don't have anything to do with the well-being of the people who have weird projects.
Does a theory of well-being need to project independent, or agent neutral?Â  Maybe you can say that there are a minimal set of functionings that are necessary but not sufficient for well-being (things like enough food, companionship, having and pursuing projects, etc.). I certainly believe that. Primary goods. But after the basic level, well-being becomes relativized to individuals and their projects. There is a shared common core to well-being, and an agent-relative wrapping.
