On Sunday, December 2nd, people around the world (108 cities) will <a href="http://www.walkforcapitalism.org/">Walk for Capitalism</a>! Tired of clueless protests against liberty and prosperity? Check to see if <a href="http://www.walkforcapitalism.org/#cities">your city</a> is involved, and walk in celebration of freedom, markets and commercial culture! I'll be joining <a href="http://www.walkforcapitalism.org/washington/index.html">Washington, D.C.</a> folks at the Rosslyn Metro at 2:00 pm on Sunday, and we'll stroll down to <a href="http://www.iotaclubandcafe.com/">Iota</a> in Clarendon and party like capitalists should. Should be fun!
