<p>Kevin Drum <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_08/009386.php">attempts to answer my question</a> about income inequality. He fails.&nbsp;He&nbsp;tries out a few hypotheses about the mechanism underlying ineuality in income growth and ...&nbsp;he is <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2006/08/the_secret_mech.html">unceremoniously dissected by Russ Roberts</a>, a real economist. After flicking over each of Drum's ideas, Russ says:</p> <blockquote> <p>The real problem with these theories of inequality is that they fail to see that the income distribution is an emergent phenomenon rather than under someone's nefarious control.</p></blockquote> <p>That's part of what I was&nbsp;rather longwindedly getting at in my last inequality post. The statist liberal pundits seem to be so weak on microfoundations that they&nbsp;end up offering simply&nbsp;baffling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underpants_Gnomes#The_gnomes">Underpants Gnome</a> explanations.&nbsp;Russ quotes <a href="http://www.coyoteblog.com/coyote_blog/2006/08/more_zero_sum_e.html">this nice bit</a> from Warren Meyer of Coyote Blog:</p> <blockquote> <p>What's bizarre about all of these statements is it treats wealth, and in this case specifically income growth, like a phenomena that is independent of individuals and their actions.&nbsp; They treat income growth like it is a natural spring bubbling up from the ground, and a few piggy people have staked out places by the well and take all the water before the rest of us can get any.</p></blockquote> <p>The mysterious world of&nbsp;numinous unmoored macro&nbsp;forces that are <em>somehow</em> rigged to benefit just the rich is a world of magic and wonder. Good thing we don't live there. &nbsp;</p>
