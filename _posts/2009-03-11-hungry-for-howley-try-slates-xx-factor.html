If you've been missing your daily dose of the withering wit of Kerry Howley ever since she stopped blogging at Hit &amp; Run, have I got good news for you! You can now satisfy your hankering for your favorite cosmotarian feminist at <a href="http://slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/">Slate's XX Factor</a> blog (one X beyond superpowered mutants, one X short of hardcore porn), where Kerry is now a regular contributor. Today, Kerry tells Michele Obama <a href="http://slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/archive/2009/03/11/dispatches-from-the-white-house-kitchen.aspx">where to stuff her nutrition facts</a>.
