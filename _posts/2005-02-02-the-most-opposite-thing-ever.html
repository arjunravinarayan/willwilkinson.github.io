This absolutely <a href="http://www.nyobserver.com/pages/frontpage6.asp">arbitrary and wonderful Observer article</a> about indie guys who also happen to like football contains some gems. My favorite:

<blockquote>And what about the girls? Indie-rock girlfriends, who thought that when they started dating music boys they were leaving football Sunday behind forever, are pissed off to discover that they thought they were getting Joe Strummer but actually got Joe Buck. In fact, at the league-championship party in Bushwick, the host’s girlfriend took off during the game to do the most opposite thing ever—make a mix tape on the occasion of her friend’s little sister’s first period.</blockquote>

The most opposite thing ever!
