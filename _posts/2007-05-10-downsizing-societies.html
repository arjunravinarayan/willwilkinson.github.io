I must admit to being rather baffled by natalist proposals in general, which leads, in particular, to the kind of absurdity proposed by Liam below. One reason for by bafflement is that I am so stridently anti-nationalist, and find the mistake of confusing nation-states for society so stupid that I literally cannot understand it. Further, I am an emprical, optimistic, cosmopolitan, liberal cultural dynamist.

It is hard precisely to tote up loses and gains in liberty, but I am certain that almost all of these countries have become on more free on net over the last half-century. And the revealed preference of hundreds of millions is life under institutions of freedom, and this massive movement of people has not tended to endanger these institutions.

For one thing, I don't really know what that would mean. I don't know how to tell where one culture ends and another begins, or how to make the cultural distinction between adaptation and speciation.

What I care about are the institutions of freedom, and I think these are
