There is little doubt that the growth of health insurance is a desirable development. And perhaps there is a case for making it compulsory, since many who could thus provide for themselves might otherwise become a public charge.  But there are strong arguments against a single scheme of state insurance; and there seems to be an overwhelming case against a free health service for all. ...
