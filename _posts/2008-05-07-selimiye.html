Yesterday Kerry and I rented a ridiculously large boat with a crew of two in the little fishing village of <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=102979212918223821859.00044caa6f035890be8ee&amp;ll=36.719898,28.042517&amp;spn=3.636453,7.338867&amp;z=7">Selimiye</a>, near the point where the Aegean meets the Mediterranean. They took us around to little islands off the coast and to good swimming spots. The water, as you can see, is astonishingly clear and, in the shallows, is the color they paint the bottom swimming pools, I guess to make them look like the Aegean. The highlight of the trip was our time exploring a small island containing the ruins of a Greek Christian monastary, now inhabited only by a herd of goats and a lonely donkey.

Today, we're in Pammukale, which is weird and awesome. <a href="http://kerryhowley.com/2008/05/07/cotton-castle/">Kerry's got a pic</a>.
