Here's some more schematic thoughts about inequality and democracy.

Liberal egalitarians like Scheffler and Anderson, argue convincingly that the point of equality is not to minimize the effects of fortune on individuals' prospects, but to ensure that members of society have a kind of equal social and political <em>standing</em>.  As a historical matter, they're just right: liberal equality is the view that we are free <em>because</em> we are equal -- because no one has the right to rule in virtue of birth or prior privilege; because no one is in a position to bend others their ends, to dominate or oppress. And that's what I'm about, too.

But then I find I part ways quickly with most other liberals who share the authentically liberal view of the point of equality. For most non-classical liberals, liberal equality turns out to involve some really quite substantial requirements about democracy and equality in democratic voice and participation. And this is usually taken to have fairly major distributive implications. As Julian Lamont and Christie Favor pithily make the point in <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/">the SEP entry on "distributive justice".</a>
<blockquote>[V]ery large wealth differentials may make it practically impossible for poor people to be elected to political office or to have their political views represented. These inequalities of wealth, even if they increase the material position of the least advantaged group, may need to be reduced in order [to secure "the fair value of the political liberties"].</blockquote>
Well, I seem to lack the  democratic equality gene in much the same way I lack the material equality gene. I just don't get it. My basic values are broadly welfarist. I want people to be doing more or less as well as they can be doing. Otherwise, I think people would have a reason to reject the current system in favor of one in which they could be doing better. If I was behind the Rawlsian veil, and I was faced with choice between a system in which I, the risk-averse potentially poor, would be (a) a bit richer in primary goods for sure but a bit less democratically influential or (b) a bit more democratically influential, but not as rich for sure, then ... well, the very possibility of (b) would lead me to seriously consider that there is something wrong with this particular way of thinking about the value of the political liberties. The idea that political liberties need to have "fair value" is that the need to actually do you some good and not be "merely formal". If securing their fair value actually requires that I be made <em>worse off</em> materially than I might have been, that seems neither fair nor valuable.

Now, I like democracy well enough. Correctly specified, democratic institutions are part of what people need. We need collective choice mechanisms to avoid hyper-individualist veto-player gridlock when it comes to making decisions about public goods. And we need a "kick the bums out" mechanisms to minimize the potential harm of incompetent public administration, including political predation. More specifically, we need to sharply limit the scope of collective choice to avoid exactly the kind of oppression and domination liberal egalitarians are supposed to care about. The point of democracy is to make decisions about public goods where unanimous consent is not achievable, not to make decisions for people when they could more effectively make those decisions themselves through voluntary agreement and exchange. Pace Benjamin Barber types, democracy is not <em>for</em> deliberating over every aspect of common life. The point is not that we all get together all the time to determine the kind of society "we" want. The point is to solve a delimited set of coordination problems that will leave us all worse off if unsolved. So what we want is high-quality decisions about public goods and public administration within an institutional structure that limits the power of the agents with final decision rights to dominate and exploit their principals. But if you talk like this to a modern democratic liberal, she'll look at you like you're speaking Vulcan.

At the IHS Social Change Workshop at Brown, <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Political_Theory_Project/postdoc/CurrentResearchAssociates.html#ross">Jason Brennan</a> had a nice analogy. What kind of things are institutions? Are they like hammers, good for what they do? Are they like paintings or novels, perhaps good for what they <em>mean </em>or <em>symbolize, </em>or maybe good because of who made them or for their intrinsic formal properties. Or are they like persons, good just because of what they are. It obvious to me, and to Jay, that institutions are hammers. And so democratic institutions are hammers. They solve a problem. But you read a lot of democratic theory and you'll swear people think democracy is good because of what it symbolizes or because it is democracy.

In <em>Unequal Democracy</em>, Larry Bartels makes a lot of the fact that Senators pay more attention to rich voters than poor voters. This deeply offends the sensibility of democratic egalitarian liberals like Bartels, and I think most strongly democratically-leaning liberal philosophers. But I left that chapter of Bartels' book asking if that's a feature or a bug, especially when he mentions that one reason poor voters get less attention is that they are less likely to know who their senator is, or how to contact him or her. The poor are the least well-informed voters. They are least likely to know what policies candidates support and are least likely to have the information and ability to assess the desirability of policy.

So, suppose we amp up the democratic power -- the voice -- of the poor.  Is this likely to make policy specifically regarding the welfare of the poor better or worse than policy determined by more-informed voters? It seems there is every reason to believe that the quality of policy would go down. A taste for democratic equality and a prioritarian welfarist concern for the least-well off probably diverge. If the preferences of the least-informed voters are democratically effective, they might make themselves (and all of us) worse off. If the preferences of the most-informed voters are democratically effective, we'll have a kind of democratic inequality, but a likely improvement in the welfare of the poor. And what poor people <em>most </em>need to equalize their standing with respect to other members of society are the kinds of welfare gains that come from economic growth, high rates of employment, effective educational institutions, etc.

My sense is that liberal <em>elites </em>think that if they can (1) convince the poor that they represent them and (2) get the poor to vote  for liberal elites in larger numbers, then liberal elites will be better able to implement the largely redistributive policies they think will make poor better off. But that's <em>exactly like </em>my argument that poor people would be better off if we had higher growth, low unemployment, and markets in education, except for content of the policy. You shouldn't confuse this for an argument about equalizing democratic voice. Also, when it sometimes seems curiously circular. So you say we might need some redistribution to democratically empower the poor, so that they can effectively act politically in their interests. And then the elite assumption is often that in so acting, the poor will want to further increase redistribution. That is to say, the poor will want precisely what the elite believes they need.

I think my views on democracy are pretty close to the American founders: adversarial and elitist.

Adversarial: Democracy is <em>essentially</em> a carnival of interest group rent-seeking, and so you want to find a way to limit that.  You try to find a way of representing large interest groups in part so those interests can speak for themselves, in part because they will try to undermine the whole scheme if excluded, and in part so they can stymie competing interests, and in turn be stymied.

Elitist: While most people tend to be fairly effective judges of their interests in private matters, there are rather larger inequalities in knowledge relevant to public affairs and in the quality of reasoning about them. Because the <em>goal </em>is to get high-quality policy -- to produce decisions that will deliver the public goods -- the democratic process should be biased toward selecting for excellence in judgment about the commonweal.  The democratic process should be broadly participatory (universal suffrage, more or less) and in principle open to all (everyone ought to be eligible for office, more or less), in order secure the widespread conviction that the process has taken everyone fairly into account and that the results therefore merit our acceptance, even if some of us don't like the way it turned out. This is necessary for the stability and peacefulness of the process. But the process should not be populist in the sense that the opinions of the least informed in the end carry as much weight as those of the best informed. That would simply defeat the purpose--good policy that tends to leave everyone better off.

Now, if the interests or preferences of separate economic classes were adversarial, then it would be a big problem if knowledge was correlated with class, which it is. So whether you can accept my old-school instrumentalist vision of democracy probably turns on whether you think wealthier, more educated people are prone to try to exploit the less advantaged. This is not my worry. The wealthier, more-educated people who by and large constitute the effective opinion elite are deeply invested in a status games in which they feel compelled to signal their commitment to humanitarian moral ideals. By itself, that's excellent! My worry is that the things you need to say, the causes you need to support, in order to make a succesful move in the signaling game are at best loosely related to the policies and causes that would in fact help the least advantaged. So the problem is not that the interests of the rich are opposed to the interests of the poor. The problem is that the interests of the relatively educated and wealthy are determined by moral fashion. If good ideas are met with scowls on editoral pages and cocktail parties, then  the influence of these ideas will be meager, to the detriment of those who would be helped. The danger is that our fervent commitment to the signaling game too easily persuades of our the authenticity of our humanitarianism. My worry is that a passionate opposition to income inequality, is an
