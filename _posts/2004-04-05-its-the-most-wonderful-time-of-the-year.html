-- Julian has <a href="http://www.juliansanchez.com/2004_04_01_notesarch.html#108113943574364823">announced the next Blogorama</a>. Thursday, April 8, 7:00-ish, Rendevous, Adams Morgan, 18th & Kalorama. No longer a novelty, the Blogorama on Kalorama is now a Washington institution, albeit a pathethic and low-rent institution.
