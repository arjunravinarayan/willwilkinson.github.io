In today's installment of <em>Cato Unbound</em>, Reason senior editor <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/08/brian-doherty/the-many-paths-to-libertarianism/">Brian Doherty defends "folk activism"</a> (that's we do here at Cato, in case you're wondering) against <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/06/patri-friedman/beyond-folk-activism/">Patri Friedman's complaints of ineffectuality</a>. 

Doherty argues, in effect, that Friedman's effort to simply <a href="http://seasteading.org/">go out and float a boat on which one can do whatever floats one's boat</a> is parasitic on earlier "folk activist" aimed at persuasion. It is hard to find <a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/">20,000 people who will commit to moving to </a><a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/">New Hampshire</a><a href="http://www.freestateproject.org/"> for the cause of liberty</a> and, as Brian points out, it's even harder to find people who will now commit to moving to a man-made island. The viability of projects like Seasteading seems to depend on the success of prior evangelism. 

That said, one of the merits of Friedman's "<a href="http://seasteading.org/seastead.org/new_pages/dynamic_geography.html">dynamic geography</a>" is that it is not really a "libertarian" project at all. As he writes in his <em>Unbound</em> lead essay:
<blockquote>Because we have no a priori knowledge of the best form of government, the search for good societies requires experimentation as well as theory — trying many new institutions to see how they work in practice.</blockquote>
I think there's good reason to expect competing sea-top jurisdictions to settle on a scheme of governance more libertarian than what the world's current nation states have to offer. But I also think there's little reason to expect a seastead to embody the system of most libertarians' dreams unless a lot of libertarians coordinate and settle there. In that case, it's really clear that creating a libertarian society from whole cloth depends on the prior existence of libertarians, which depends on the success of the folk activism that produces them.
