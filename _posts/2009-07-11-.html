I don't think I really made it clear that your book isn't at all polemical. It's a very detailed (but fun to read!) attempt toÂ <em>explain </em>how we got here, to make public the "secret history of getting high in America." Why do you think it's so important that this history isn't secret?

<em>This is Your Country on Drugs</em> is a treasure trove of fun facts about the history of drugs in America. What discovery was most surprising to you? Most revealing?
