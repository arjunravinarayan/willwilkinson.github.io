Back from a lovely day in Charm City. If you're a DC-ite, or visiting Baltimore from elsewher, <a href="http://www.avam.org/">The American Visionary Art Museum</a> is well worth the trip. I can be pretty skeptical of "outsider art," and there are a few drunk, short-bus-riding pre-schooler paintings, but there was also a lot of really amazing stuff in the collection. It's small, so it can be enjoyed beginning-to-end in a couple hours. And then take a walk around Federal Hill and enjoy the view of the harbor and the Baltimore skyline.

After, we found a great little coffe shop, <a href="http://www.pattersonperk.com/">Patterson Perk</a>, across from Patterson Park. Also recommended.
