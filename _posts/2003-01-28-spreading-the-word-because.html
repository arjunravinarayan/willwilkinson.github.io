<b>Spreading the Word</b> -- Because my link network consists mostly of <a href="http://www.analytictech.com/networks/weakties.htm">strong ties</a>, and is thus highly redundant, my readers will have already been informed. But, just in case, don't miss Blogarama at Kalorama III, Thursday, February 6 at the Rendevous Lounge in Adams Morgan. I'll be a bit late. I've got class, the nicely titled <a href="http://www.philosophy.umd.edu/people/faculty/pcarruthers/879.htm">Architecture of the Mind</a>, with <a href="http://www.philosophy.umd.edu/people/faculty/pcarruthers/peter.JPG">Carruthers</a>. So don't leave early, especially if you're gorgeous and single (and female)!
