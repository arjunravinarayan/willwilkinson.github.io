In an interesting post about Yuval Levin's inability to actually define "human dignity" despite leaning on it so heavily in a new book, James Poulos points out that even the great individualist George Kateb is tempted to appeal to human dignity when trying to explain why he thinks there is no individual right to things like consensual incest or necrophilia. James continues:
<blockquote>Here a liberal winds up in the same predicament Yuval diagnoses among conservatives. It turns out that contemporary science and politics alike cause us to treat forbidden things precisely as if they were not forbidden — as the precondition of forming our ‘value judgments’ about them! But why? Perhaps the culprit is scientific and political individualism — methodologically individualist in the first case and rights-based in the second. We have discovered that both these kinds of individualism are in fact corrosive to individual identity. Methodological individualism tells us that only large-n statistical studies, in which the individual is minimized to his or her most interchangeable, can produce usable knowledge; rights-based individualism tells us that people must be allowed to interact expressively in ways that disrupt and undermine the boundaries of personal integrity as long as they want to and ‘aren’t hurting anybody’, although we all recognize that the ‘line’ between what counts as hurting and what doesn’t is, by the lights of rights, arbitrary or inexplicable. So the inevitable result is ‘unrebuttable’ personal testimonies about how you can <a href="http://www.willwilkinson.net/flybottle/2008/04/07/i-wouldnt-say-incest-is-best/">commit incest and still be a perfectly normal person</a>.</blockquote>
The predicament James mentions is reminds me of the problem of setting out a "theory of optimal disenchantment." Here's how I put it:
<blockquote>[I]t seems possible to provide a sound theory of optimal disenchantment, and somebody ought to try. The problem is that a convincing theory of optimal disenchantment will have be drawn from a point on the continuum to the right of the putative optimum. A good theory will need to draw from the<em>epistemically</em> best conception of human nature, and show us how believing such and such can in fact be expected to produce bad behavior and undermine good institutions, and that believing this or that falsehood is in fact a precondition for everything that makes living worthwhile. But the epistemically best theory will be the most disenchanted one. And those most motivated to set forth a theory of optimal disenchantment are not those most prepared to lay aside the prevailing ideology in order to really understand the disenchanted facts.</blockquote>
As Levin puts it in the passage Jame quotes:
<blockquote>The nature of both modern science and modern politics demands that the argument proceed in this way. Both incessantly unveil the veiled and shine light on hidden things. We gain much that is immensely beneficial from both, but we risk losing much if the process of transforming sentiments into arguments is not carried out properly.</blockquote>
But knowing how to transform a sentiment of moralized disgust <em>properly </em>requires something like a prior theory of optimal disenchantment to tell us when the veiled must remain veiled and when the darkness must remain unillumined. But such a theory cannot be had unless one disregards the "risk of losing much" while determining whether there really is any risk of loss.

I don't think I understand James' idea of the liberal version of the predicament. I don't recognize methodological individualism as implying anything about large-n statistical studies. I also don't see recognition of individual rights as implying that harm is inexplicable or arbitrary. On the contrary, the content of a right tends be an answer to the questions what kind of harms must be taken seriously.

A sorting of acts into those permitted and those forbidden on grounds of human dignity seems to me to face the same kind of problem. The lesson of history is that things once considered beneath dignity like consorting with members of "inferior" races, proved not to be inconsistent with dignity at all. So the claim that X is inconsistent with human dignity must justify itself in the face of the well-supported suspicion that it is no less an unfounded prejudice as past acts accused of indignity, but acquitted by the judgment of history. One might

The claim that X is inconsistent with human dignity is either supported by inarticulable intuition or supported by articulable reasons. If it is supported by intuition, intuition can be overturned by testimony that shows the consistency of X and human dignity. Someone you admire and consider vested with dignity (Ha! I didn't know until just now that the incest link went to my blog.) of If it is supported by reasons, then there is a theory of human dignity. If it is supported by good reasons, it is supported by a true theory of human dignity
