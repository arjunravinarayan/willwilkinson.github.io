Julian's <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj25n3/cj25n3-19.pdf">new Cato Journal review</a> [pdf] of Ted Honderich's bizarrely titled, <em>Conservatism: Burke, Nozick, Bush, Blair?</em> is ripping good fun, showing that it is much more satsifying to review bad books than good ones. Snippet:
<blockquote>
. . . this is an exceedingly mean bookâ€”again, in more than one sense of the term. It is the sort of thing Ann Coulter might produce if she were a leftist and fancied herself a serious thinker.
</blockquote>
