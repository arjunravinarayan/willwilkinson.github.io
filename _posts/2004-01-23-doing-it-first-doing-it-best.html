-- Gawker Media has launched a <a href="http://www.wonkette.com/">new blog</a> devoted to gossip about the Federal City side of the District. Despite their innovative reputation, let it not go unsaid that in this instance Gawker is derivative. <a href="http://www.swamp-city.com/">Swamp City</a> has been covering the same beat for some time now, with panache. You should add it to your blogrolls forthwith, so that the Swamp City chick will stop pestering me.
