-- Since my window for interest in Iowa-themed posts is now closing, let me just point out that Iowa comes out as the 47th most corrupt state in the union in <a href="http://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/corruptreport.pdf">this study</a>.  When I tell people Iowa was a good place to grow up, this sort of thing is part of what I mean. People with a conscience, unlike those shifty bastards up in North Dakota (#2)! But I guess my Saskatchewegian dad had to move to Nebraska (#50) to avoid the relatively malign nature of Iowa public life.
