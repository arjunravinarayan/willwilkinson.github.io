Today <a href="http://www.bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/8348">on Free Will I chat with Tim Harford</a> about his new book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1400066425?tag=theflybottle-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=1400066425&amp;adid=01033HJ0PYYTNPS7F7D3&amp;">The Logic of Life</a>. </em>

Tim's book isn't just another foray into pop econ. It's a fascinating and entertaining overview and synthesis of a good deal of the most important recent research in economics. I wasn't expecting to discover work that would help me on my inequality project, but I did.
