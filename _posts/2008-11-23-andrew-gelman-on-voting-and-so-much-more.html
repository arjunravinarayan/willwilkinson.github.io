In this week's episode of Free Will, I chat with Columbia political scientist and statistician Andrew Gelman about his book <em>Red State, Blue State, Rich State Poor State</em>, the election, why rich people are increasingly voting Democratic, and even a bit about happiness. Andrew is a man of exceeding epistemic virtue and was worried that he riffed too much on topics outside of his expertise. Of course, I have no such scruples, and found the chat fascinating, because Andrew is. Â
