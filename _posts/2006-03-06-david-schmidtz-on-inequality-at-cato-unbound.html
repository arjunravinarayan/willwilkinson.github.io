This month's <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org"><em>Cato Unbound</em></a> ought to be catnip for Fly Bottle readers. Dave Schmidtz kicks off this month's issue with a great little essay about "<a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/03/06/david-schmidtz/when-equality-matters/">When Inequality Matters</a>." It draws from his new book, <a title="Elements of Justice" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521539366/theflybottle-20"><em>Elements of Justice</em></a>, which is, to my mind, the best book in libertarian political thought since Nozick, and truly deserves wide attention.

Dave is one of my biggest philosophical (and personal) influences, and I can't help but think the world would be better off if he influenced more people's thinking. I hope you'll take a look at Dave's essay, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521539366/theflybottle-20">buy his book</a>, and if you have a blog, tell us what you think. Peter Singer will comment on Wednesday, Cato's Tom Palmer on Friday, and Yale's Jacob Hacker next Monday. Should be good stuff.
