Brink Lindsey gets <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/books/review/Will-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;em&amp;en=1b9888643af84f7e&amp;ex=1181448000">a rave review for his new book</a> from George Will in this weekend's NYT Book Review. <em>The Age of Abundance </em>is, Will says, a "scintillating book." It is! Congrats, Brink.

While we're at it, Brink has <a href="http://brink.pjdoland.com/?p=81">a great post on secularization trends</a> at his revived blog.
