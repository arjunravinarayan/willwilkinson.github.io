Well, I've been doing a horrible job keeping the cobwebs off this here thing. You didn't even know I'd gone. Well, I just got back from the IHS grad student seminar at Stanford. The quality of students just keeps getting better. There is simply nothing quite like it. But the best part for me is seeing faculty who have become friends through my years at IHS. I'll fly across the continent to see John Nye, Dave Schmidtz, Mike Munger, and John Tomasi any day. Barry Weingast, Avner Greif, Leda Cosmides, and Mark Turner... icing on the cake. Munger, who looks increasingly like <a href="http://www.progressiveboink.com/archive/ihbfd/hairbear.htm">Hair Bear</a> (but with pants and sans neckerchief), has <a href="http://mungowitzend.blogspot.com/2006/07/dish.html">a  summary</a> of his week. The weather in Palo Alto is . . . nice. Getting wireless internet access, though, at the West Coast's best university, in the heart of silicon Valley, was surprisingly hard. Or surprisingly backward, I should say. And I had no idea Stanford ("the Farm"!) would seem so remote and rural.  Really lovely. Munger's right that the dorms sucked, but, stepping outside, I've never been on a better smelling campus. For what that's worth.
