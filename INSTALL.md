1. Created Gemfile, with added requirements for Wordpress import.
2. Copy wordpress archive as old.xml
3. Imported Wordpress using 
jekyll import wordpressdotcom --source old.xml
4. Install a random theme (can be changed later). I chose
https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes. Using their config file
verbatim, and followed the instructions under "Setup for an Existing
Jekyll site".
