* Clean up the header image (change jpg dimensions?)
* Set up links on the top navigation bar (in _config.yml)
* Set a favicon
* Quoted text font size is too big

* Paginate the "all articles" page. Currently it is 1mb, and 20000 lines of HTML. Currently it is straining my Nexus 4.

* Set up disqus comments
* Set up google analytics tracking

* Add CNAME to willwilkinson.net

* Reformat Twitter card information
* Reformat Facebook open graph infomation

* Check iPad and iPhone and Android viewability (!!!)
* iPad:
* iPhone:
* Android phone: Looks good and works great except the articles page is too big.

* Maybe minify all the jss into one request? Maybe github takes care
  of this so its not a big deal...
